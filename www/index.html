<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Mentiko Betuah" tags="" position="7,551">A long time ago, there was a kingdom in Semeulue, Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam. The king and the queen had a son, the prince. They loved the prince very much. They always gave him anything he wanted and that made him grow as a spoiled young man.

The king realized his mistake. He wanted to give the prince a lesson. He asked the prince to leave the palace and became a merchant.

&quot;I will give you some money. Use the money only for trading. Don&#39;t come back until you are rich!&quot; asked the king.

The prince was sad. He knew his father was angry with him because he was a spoiled boy. He then promised to himself that he could become a great merchant.

After he left the palace, he went to a village. While he was walking, he saw some kids were trying to shoot a bird using their slingshots.

&quot;Stop! Don&#39;t hurt the bird! I&#39;ll give you some money if you stop hurting him,&quot; said the prince. 

After that, he gave some money to those kids.

Later, he saw some men were torturing a snake. Again, the prince asked them to stop hurting the snake. He also gave them some money. He kept on giving some money to people who tortured animals. Finally he did not have any money at all. He was so worried. He knew he could not become a merchant without any money in his pocket. He was also scared of going home. His father would be very angry at him.

Next, the prince went to the forest. He did not know anywhere to go. While he was sitting under a big tree, a giant snake came to him. He was so frightened.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, young man. I will not eat you. I am the king of snakes in this jungle. I heard you helped many animals from being tortured. Now, I want to give you a gift. This is Mentiko Betuah. This magical stone can give you anything you want.&quot;

The prince was happy. He asked the Mentiko Betuah to give him a lot of money. Amazingly, the prince later had a lot of money. So he went home and told his father that the money was from his business as a merchant.

The prince kept the Mentiko Betuah carefully. He went to a goldsmith and asked him to make the magical stone as a ring. Unfortunately, the goldsmith stole the Mentiko Betuah. The prince was angry. Luckily he had made friends with the animals. Then they all helped him find the Mentiko Betuah.

A cat, a dog, and a mouse went together to find the magical stone. They finally found the goldsmith. However they could not enter his house, only the mouse could. After waiting for a moment, the mouse came out of the house. He said he could not find the magical stone.

After that they all went back to the palace. The cat and the dog did not know that the mouse actually had found the magical stone. He was hiding it in his mouth. He then gave the Mentiko Betuah to the prince. He was so happy and said that the mouse was the hero.

The cat and the dog were jealous and angry. They tried to kill the mouse. That&#39;s why until now cats and dogs always try to catch mice.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Banta and the Princess" tags="" position="8,426">BANTA Berensyah was a good young man. He lived with his old mother. They were poor. Banta worked for his rich uncle. He never complained although his uncle only gave him little money for his job. His uncle was a rich merchant He had a big ship to cruise the ocean. However, nobody liked him. His uncle was stingy. He was also rude, he never said nice things to people.

Unlike his uncle people loved Banta very much. He was helpful and kind. He always helped people. And, there is one thing that people admired from Banta. He was skillful playing a flute. It was so great that people were so happy to hear him playing the flute.

Banta was in love with the princess. She was very beautiful. She just made an announcement, She would marry a man who could give her a cloth made from gold. Banta heard the competition and he wanted to join it. He wanted to marry the princess. Banta told his mother about the competition.

&quot;What will you do, Son? A cloth from gold is so expensive, how will you get it?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, Mother. Just pray for me, and I will find a way.&quot;

Banta prayed to God. He asked God to show him away how he could get a cloth from gold. In one night, he had a dream. An old man told him that he prepared a big leaf. He would use the leaf to cross the sea. The old man told him that he had to head north and land in a big island.

Banta woke up from his sleep. He was sure that the dream was a guidance for him. He went to the jungle and looked for the biggest leaf. When he found it, he folded and put it in his bag. Then he told his mother that he would get golden cloth.

Banta went to his uncle, &quot;Uncle, may I join you in your ship. I want to head north.&quot;

&quot;But I will head south,&quot; said his uncle.

&#39;&quot;Ihat&#39;s OK, Uncle. I will drop in the middle of the ocean and continue my journey by myself.&quot;

The uncle completely did not understand.

However, he still let him join his big ship. When they were in the middle of the ocean, Banta got off the ship. He used his big leaf as his &#39;ship&#39;. Amazingly, the leaf worked well. He then went north.

When Banta landed in an island he was looking for a great weaver. He looked for a weaver who could make him a cloth from gold. It was not easy for him to find the great weaver. Finally, he found one!

&quot;How will you pay me?&quot; asked the weaver.

&quot;May I play the flute for replacing the payment? I guarantee you will like it &quot; said Banta.

&quot;Hmm... OK let&#39;s try now.&quot;

Banta then played his flute. It was so great. The weaver had never heard a great sound like that before. When Banta finished playing, the weaver happily made him the cloth from gold.

Banta was so happy. He brought the cloth home. He wanted to show it to his mother first before he gave it to the princess. He used his big leaf as his ship to cross the sea.

Sadly, when he was sailing in the ocean, he met his uncle with his big ship. His uncle saw the golden cloth and grabbed it. He also wanted to marry the princess. He went to the palace and left Banta alone with his big leaf.

When Banta arrived at the palace, the wedding party of his uncle and the princess was about to start.

Suddenly, an eagle flew and screamed &#39;The golden cloth belongs to Banta!&#39;

The eagle kept on screaming that the king finally asked the uncle. The uncle finally admitted that he stole, Banta&#39;s golden cloth. The king was angry. He asked the uncle to leave the palace. And how about Banta? Well, he married the princess and lived in the palace. He also asked his mother to stay in the palace. They lived happily ever after.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="5" name="The Seven Brothers" tags="" position="0,301">THERE was a village in Aceh. The people were farmers. They lived happily. Their land was fertile. All types of trees grew very well. However, their happiness soon ended. The area suffered a long drought.

Their fertile land and their trees dried. Everybody was so sad and worried. And that included a family with seven children. The parents were so worried that their children would be starving. They were planning to put their children in a safe place.

&quot;Do you know a good place for our children?&quot; asked the wife.

&quot;I&#39;m thinking to put them in a jungle. I know it&#39;s far from here but at least our children can eat fruits. I&#39;m sure they won&#39;t be starving,&quot; explained the husband.

&quot;But please bring them back home if the drought is over,&quot; asked the wife.

&quot;I will, honey. I will,&quot; promised the husband.

They did not know that the oldest son overheard their conversation. On the following day, the father asked all of his seven sons to go with him to the jungle. He told them that they would take some firewood.

All the children joined their father. And when they arrived, the father asked them to build a tree house. And when it was finished, they rested. And while all the children were sleeping, the father left.

The youngest son was crying. He was looking for his father. The oldest son tried to console his brother. He then told his brothers about the conversation he heard.

&quot;Our parents did not want us to be hungry. You know our village is suffering the long drought they want us to have enough food. There are so many fruits here, don&#39;t worry.&quot;

The seven brothers then lived in the jungle. They waited and waited for their father to pick them back. But he never came. They got bored, and they decided to go back home. Sadly, they were lost!

They were walking and stopped at a very big house. It was a giants house!

While they were amazed with the size of the house, the door was opened! They were scared! They were ready to run away and suddenly they heard a voice.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, please come in,&quot; it was a female giant.

Her husband was not at home.

The seven brothers entered the house. They were so amazed everything was so big. They sat down on big chairs. In front of them there was a big table. And the female giant served them food on big plates. Those children had difficulty eating using big spoon and forks. But they were happy.

They finally could eat delicious food. They almost fed up eating fruits in the jungle.

After they finished eating, the female giant asked them to leave.

Her husband would go home soon and he liked eating humans. The female giants then gave them lots of gold and jewelries. The seven brothers continued their journey. They were still lost and did not know where to go home. They arrived in a small village.

They decided to stay and bought a house for them to live. And they also bought a piece of land to cultivate. They were really grateful with the fold given by the female giants. Thanks to the gold they could buy all the things they needed.

The seven brothers worked hard. They soon became rich. They missed their parents every day. They saved lots of money for their journey to go back home. And when they thought their money was much enough, they started to go back home. They were adults then.

They started their journey. They spent lots of money for the transportation. And after spending days of travelling, they finally got home! Their parents were very old. And they looked very weak. The parents were extremely happy. They thought they would never see their children again. Then the family reunited. They were rich and they lived happily.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="6" name="The Parakeet King" tags="" position="0,301">In the jungle of Aceh, parakeet birds live peacefully with their wise king. However, now their peaceful life is disturbed. A hunter goes into their jungle and plans to catch them.

It&#39;s a beautiful morning. The parakeets and their king perch on a branch of tree. They do not know that the hunter is hiding. The hunter wants to catch the parakeets with his net.

The hunter throws his net towards the parakeets. Some parakeets and the parakeet king are caught under the net. The parakeets are scared but the parakeet king tells them what to do.

&quot;Relax. I have a plan. We all pretend to be dead. When the hunter lifts the net up, we fly fast to the sky,&quot; advise the parakeet king.

The hunter goes to his net. He is upset! He thinks all the parakeets are dead.

&quot;Oh no! I can&#39;t sell dead birds to people.&quot; He then lifts the net up.

Not long after that, the parakeets free themselves and fly to the sky. But the parakeet king is still trapped. He does not want to fly to the sky until the parakeets are free.

The hunter is surprised when he sees the parakeets are flying. He sees there is one parakeet left in the net.

He moves quickly.

&quot;Gotcha!&quot; he catches the parakeet king.

And then the hunter goes home. He puts the parakeet king in a birdcage.

In the jungle, all the parakeets are sad because their king is locked in a birdcage. They set a plan to free their king. All the parakeets fly to the hunter&#39;s house. With their beaks, the parakeets peck the birdcage. Slow but sure, the birdcage is destroyed. Then the parakeet king can free himself.

“Thank you. You all are very kind to me. Without your help, I&#39;m still trapped in this birdcage, &quot;says the parakeet king.</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Sipiso Somalim" tags="" position="151,303">ONCE upon a time, there was a kingdom in North Sumatra. The people lived happily. The land was fertile and the place was safe. The king had a sister. Her name was Siboru Sandebona. She married to a king from a neighboring kingdom.

Siboru Sandebona was pregnant. It was the ninth month of her pregnancy but there was no signs that the baby would be born.

The king asked his advisor. He told the king that the baby would be a great man. When he grew up, he would have a great supernatural power. He could control animals easily!

Finally, the baby boy was born. Siboru Sandebona and her husband named him Sipiso Somalim. Everybody was happy. The baby was cute and very healthy.

Although Sipiso Somalim was a prince, he was not arrogant. He was polite and very kind to others. He was also helpful. He was willing to work in the rice fields. He had an ox that always accompanied him plowing the field. The ox was so tamed to Sipiso Somalim.

With his power, he could control the ox.

Then, Sipiso Somalim grew up. He was in love with a princess from another kingdom. Sipiso Somalim told his parents that he would propose the princess. They agreed and asked a soldier named Sipakpakhumal to accompany the prince.

Nobody knew that Sipakpakhumal was also in love with the princess. She was so beautiful and Sipakpakhumal also wanted to marry her. Sipakpakhumal had been thinking how he could marry the princess.

He finally got an idea when Sipiso Somalim told him that he wanted to take a bath in a lake. It was so hot and they decided to get some rest.

When Sipiso Somalim was swimming, Sipakpakhumal took all Sipiso Somalimls belongings, the clothes and the sword. Sipakpakhumal wore Sipiso Somalim&#39;s clothes and kept Sipiso Somalim&#39;s swords. When he finished swimming, Sipiso Somilim was surprised to see that Sipakpakhumal was wearing his clothes. He could not find his sword either.

&quot;What&#39;s happening here?&quot; asked Sipiso Somalim

&quot;From now on I&#39;m Sipiso Somalim and you are Sipakpakhumal. Do you understand?&#39;

Sipiso Somalim knew that his guard was planning something bad. He just did not know what the plan was. So he just cooperated nicely and acted as a guard.

When they arrived, the fake Sipiso Somalim told the king that he wanted to marry his daughter. The princess was suspicious. She had heard that Sipiso Somalim was handsome and strong.

&quot;Why is he so different from what I heard?&quot; asked the princess softly to his father.

The father also felt that there was something wrong. So he told the fake Sipiso Somalim that they needed time to decide. He let the fake Sipiso Somalim and his &#39;guard&#39; to stay in the palace.

During their stay in the palace, the fake Sipiso Somalim treated &#39;Sipakpakhumal&#39; like a servant. He also told &#39;Sipakpakhumal&#39; to plow the king&#39;s rice fields.

One day, the princess saw how &#39;Sipakpakhumal&#39; was plowing the fields. He did not do anything, he was just sitting and playing flute while the ox was plowing the field.

The princess told the king about&#39;sipakpakhumat&#39;. The king finally realized the problem. He had heard that the real Sipiso Somalim had power to control animals. So he asked the fake Sipiso Somalim to plow the field with an ox, but he was not allowed to be near the ox. The fake Sipiso Somalim could not do it.

The king was angry. He threatened the fake Sipiso Somalim to tell him the truth, otherwise he would be sent to jail. The fake Sipiso Somalim was so scared. He told the king that he was not a prince, his &#39;guard&#39; was the real Sipiso Somalim.

When the king knew the truth, he held a wedding party. Sipiso Somalim and the princess finally got married. They lived happily ever after.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Gundala-Gundala Dance" tags="" position="156,428">THERE was a kingdom in Karo, North Sumatra. The king and the queen had a daughter. She was a very beautiful princess. She was kind, polite, and helpful to others. The king and the queen loved her very much.

The princess was in love with a young soldier. And the soldier also loved the princess. He was a great man. He mastered great martial arts. He was also skillful with weapons. And he was a handsome man. He treated the princess very well. He had a dream that he could marry and be her husband.

The king and the queen knew about their daughter&#39;s relationship with the soldier. They agreed and blessed the relationship. The soldier, asked a permission to see the king. He wanted to propose the princess.

&quot;Your Majesty, as you know I have a special relationship with your daughter. I love her very much, and I&#39;d like to ask your permission to marry her,&quot; said the soldier.

The king was silent. Actually he had been waiting for this moment to come.

He thought $at his daughter was adult enough to get married.

The king then spoke, I will give you my permission. But you have to promise that you will always love her, treat her well, and protect her.&quot;

&quot;I will, Your Majesty ... I will,&quot; said the soldier happily.

Soon the wedding was held. The king and the queen invited all the people in the kingdom to come and have fun at the party.

The king loved hunting. And one day he asked the soldier, who was his son-in-law to accompany him go hunting.

And while they were hunting, suddenly a big bird came to them. The bird was very big. And they had never seen a big bird like that.

Well, it was not an ordinary bird. The bird was a transformation of a holy man. Because of that he was able to talk with humans.

The king liked the bird. He asked the bird to stay at the palace. The bird agreed. The princess was also happy with the bird. She had a new friend that she could ask to play with her. And the princess was not the only person who loved the bird.

Everybody in the kingdom also loved the bird. And one day the princess was playing with the bird. She was so happy that she accidentally touched the bird&#39;s beak.

&quot;Don&#39;t touch my beak! I don&#39;t like it!&quot; said the bird.

Since then the bird acted strangely. He attacked the princess!

The soldier protected his wife. He attacked back the bird. He used his martial art skill to fight the bird. However, the bird did not give up. He used his claws to fight the soldier. The soldier was cornered.

The king saw the fight and he was really worried.

He then screamed, &quot;Use your sword!&quot;

The soldier grabbed his sword and with one slash he killed the bird. The princess was sad. She lost her friend. The soldier was also sad. He did not intend to kill the bird but he had to protect his wife.

The people in the kingdom were also sad. They were crying. And it seemed that the Mother Nature was also sad. It started to rain heavily.

To remember the bird, people then created a dance. It was called Gundala-Gundala dance. Until now, people perform the dance when they are expecting to have rain during the drought season.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Siranggir the Cow" tags="" position="158,303">SIRANGGIR was a cow. She had some children. Every day they went to a field to eat some grass with their owner, Aji Tonggal. He was a young man and he loved his cows very much. He even could talk with them.

Aji Tonggal and his parents build a new house for them. The people had a tradition. Before a family stayed at their new house, they had to sacrifice a cow. So, the father asked Aji Tonggal to sacrifice the biggest cow they had. And it was Siranggir, the mother cow.

Siranggir was very sad. But Aji Tonggal had to listen and obey his parents. So, he went to Siranggir and explained what happened. Siranggir knew about the tradition, and he also knew that sooner or later she would also be sacrificed.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Aji Tonggal. I&#39;m ready to be sacrificed. Please promise that you will always take care of my kids after I have gone. And I have a request. Give me time to talk to my children. I want to say goodbye to them,&quot; said Siranggir.

All the children were very sad. They did not want to lose their mother. They understood about the tradition after their mother explained it to them.

Then, it was time for the ceremony. Aji Tonggal did not have the heart to kill his beloved cow. He asked somebody else to do that. After Siranggir was killed, Aji Tonggal&#39;s parents shared the meat to the neighbors. The family still kept Siranggir&#39;s head. The head was hung in the kitchen.

Several days after the ceremony, a strange thing happened to the family. Every morning, the family went to the field and when they arrived home in the afternoon, they always had food in the kitchen. The food was enough for the whole family.

Aji Tonggal was really curious. One day, he went home earlier. He saw a beautiful girl was cooking in the kitchen. Slowly he walked towards the girl, and grabbed her hand.

&quot;Please let me go. I will explain everything. I am Siranggir. Even though I&#39;m dead, I still want to dedicate my life to you. That&#39;s why I transformed my life into a girl,&quot; said the girl.

Aji Tonggal was surprised. He then looked for Siranggir&#39;s head in the kitchen. But he could not find it. Then he believed that Siranggir&#39;s head had already transformed into a young girl.

Aji Tonggal then fell in love with the girl. After that, he talked to his parents. He wanted to marry the girl. The parents agreed. Once again the family had a ceremony. This time, it was a ceremony for their marriage.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Beru Dayang" tags="" position="31,428">THERE was a kingdom led by a wise king. The people lived peacefully and happily. Daily, they ate fruits. Why not rice? Well, rice never grew there thus they did not know how rice looked like.

The kingdom suffered a long drought. It was very hot. Rain had not fallen down for a long time. Trees and animals slowly died. People were starving and they were very hungry.

Beru Dayang and his mother were also starving. Beru Dayang was still a kid. Because he had not eaten anything for days, he became very weak. He kept on crying, asking for something to eat.

His mother was hopeless. There was nothing she could do. She could not give any food to her beloved son.

Beru Dayang&#39;s condition was getting worse. His crying started to sound so weak. Finally, he could no longer cry. Beru Dayang could not say anything. He slowly took his last breath. Beru Dayang died.

His mother was screaming! She felt very sad to lose her only child. After she buriedher child, she went to the river.

&quot;Dear Gods and Goddesses, I can no longer hold this pain. Losing my child really broke my heart. There is no use for me to live any longer.&quot;

She jumped to the river. Amazingly, when her body touched the water, she became a fish! In the meantime, a tree grew on Beru Dayang&#39;s tomb. The tree had a big fruit. People did not know what kind of fruit it was. They did not care, they wanted to pick and eat the fruit.

&quot;Hurry.... Let&#39;s eat this fruit!&quot; said one man.

&quot;No! We don&#39;t know what fruit this is. We should be careful Why don&#39;t we tell the King about this fruit?&quot; asked another man.

They immediately went to the palace and brought the fruit to the king.

&quot;Your Majesty, what should we do with this fruit? Can we eat it?&quot; asked one man.

The King replied, &quot;Let me pray first, I want.to ask Gods and Goddesses what to do with this fruit.&quot;

The King prayed, he asked Gods and Goddesses&#39; guidance.

Not long after that, the King heard a voice.

It said, &quot;Don&#39;t eat the fruit! The fruit is the incarnation of a young boy named Beru Dayang. What you have to do is cut the fruit into pieces and later plant the pieces in the ground. After that you will see some small trees grow. You can get new food from the trees. You also have to help Beru Dayang find his mother!&quot;

The King obeyed and did what the voice said. He cut the fruit into pieces and later planted them.

Slowly people saw new trees. They never saw those trees before. Later the trees had some small &quot;fruits&quot;. They were white and very hard. They decided to cook the &quot;fruits&quot;. After it was cooked, they tasted it. They liked it! What &quot;fruit&quot; was that? Well, it was rice!

<tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Nai Manggale" tags="" position="0,428">Once upon a time, there lived a famous sculpture in Tapanuli, North Sumatra. His name was Datu Panggana. He could carve wood into many things. One day, he got an inspiration to carve a wood into a statue of a beautiful woman.

Then, he put the statue in front of his house. It was not finished yet. The statue still had any clothes yet. Later, a young merchant passed by in front of the Delta Panggana&#39;s house. His name was Bao Partigatiga. He sold jewelries and clothes. He was very impressed by the beauty of the statue.

&quot;She would be more beautiful by wearing my clothes,&quot; said Bao Partigatiga. 

He then put on the clothes he wanted to sell on the statue. Bao Partigatiga was very pleased now. The statue looked like a real human. Then he left Datu Panggana&#39;s house. After that, a priest and his wife passed by. They were also impressed by the beauty of the statue.

&quot;I want to pray to God to make her live like a real human. I want to make her as our daughter,&quot; said the priest to his wife.

The couple had any children yet. Their dream came true. The statue had changed into a very beautiful girl. The priest and his wife then took the girl home. They named her Nai Manggale. The news about Nai Manggale spread very fast. All the villagers came to the priest&#39;s house to see Nai Manggale. 

Among them were Datu Panggana and Bao Partigatiga.

Datu Panggana said, &quot;She has to stay in my house. The statue was mine.&quot;

But, Bao Partigatiga also claimed the same thing.

&quot;She is wearing my clothes. So, she has to stay in my house.&quot;

The priest did not want to lose Nai Manggale.

&quot;Remember, I am the one who made her live like a human. So, she stays here.&quot;

Those three men then were busy arguing. They claimed to have the rights of Nai Manggale. To calm them, an elderly of the village gave a solution. His name was Aji Bahir.

&quot;You all can have her and have a relationship with her. Datu Panggana, you are her uncle. Bao Partigatiga, you are her brother. And you the priest, you are her father.&quot;

The three men accepted Aji Bahir&#39;s advice. And now they were happy because they all could ask her to stay in their houses. Besides that, now those three men were related.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="13" name="The Story of Si Losung Lake and Si Pinggan Lake" tags="" position="0,428">THERE were two brothers, DatuDalu and Sangmaima. They were orphans. Their parents had died. The father was the master of healing. He had taught his skills in healing to his sons. The kids had learned very well and used the skills to help people.

Before their father died, he had inherited a spear to his sons. However, the tradition said that the oldest son could keep the spear. Therefore, DatuDalu was the one who kept the spear. Sangmaim could use it if DatuDalu allowed him.

Sangmaima loved hunting. He went to his brother&#39;s house to ask his permission to use the spear. His brother allowed him.

When he was in the jungle, Sangmaima saw a wild hog. He walked carefully and aimed the hog. He threw it very fast! The spear hit the hog! Sangmaima thought the hog died. He was wrong. The hog ran very fast. Unfotunately, the spear was still attached to its body.

Sangmaima was very panicky. He worried about the spear. The wild hog was bleeding, so he followed the blood trail and it led to a cave. He carefully went in side the cave. He saw an old woman and a girl. The girl was screaming in pain.

The girl saw Sangmaima coming.

She said, &quot;Mother... That&#39;s the man who threw the spear at me.&quot;

Sangmaima was complete shocked.

He said, &quot;No, I was throwing my spear at a wild hog not at you!&quot;

The old woman said, &quot;The wild hog was my daughter We are genies of the, jungle. We can change ourselves into anything. I&#39;m sure you are looking for this spear. I will give it back to you but you have to heal my daughter said the old woman.

Sangmaima acceptedthe old woman&#39;s offer.Hehealed girl and after she was cured the old woman gave him the spear. Sangmaima immediately went back home.

DatuDalu was happy when his brother returned the spear safely. He had worried something bad had happened. To express his happiness, he held a great party. He invited lot of people, however he did not invite Sangmaima and that made him upset. Sangmaima was also holding a party to balance his brother&#39;s party. There was a special performance. A girl was decorating her body like a bird. She danced beautifully.

People were amazed. More and more people came. The guests at DatuDalu&#39;s party heard that there was a great dance at Sangmaima&#39;s party. One by one, they went to Sangmaima&#39;s party,

DatuDalu saw the girl with bird&#39;s costume. He was impressed with her. He talked to Sangmaima.

&quot;May I ask her to dance in my party tomorrow?&quot;

Sangmaina said yes. On the following day, Sangmaima secretly went to DatuDalu&#39;s house. He asked the girl to leave DatuDalu&#39;s house. Later he asked his hrother.

&quot;Where is the girl?&quot;

DatuDalu said, &quot;She is still decorating herself.&quot;

&quot;Where? I don&#39;t see her in this house,&quot; said Sangmaima.

DatuDalu did not believe what his brother said so he called for the girt. Well, it was useless. Sangmaima had asked her to leave.

Sangmaima was pretending to be angry. &quot;Where is the girl? If you don&#39;t know where she is, you have to give me the spear!&quot;

DatuDalu rejected his brother&#39;s idea. They were arguing and sadly they were fighting. DatuDalu threw a mortar for pounding rice toward Sangmaima. he missed it.

The mortar landed in a field and strangely it became a lake. People then named the lake as Si Losung Lake. Losung is from the word lesung or mortar.

Sangmaima also threw a plate toward DatuDalu. He missed itl The plate landed in a field and it became a lake. People then named it as Si Pinggan Lake. Pinggan means a plate.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Baroar" tags="" position="0,428">HUTA Bargot was a kingdom in Mandailing, North Sumatra. The king was Sutan Pulungan.
He had a wife and one baby boy. The king loved hunting. One day, the king and some soldiers went to the jungle to go hunting. The king also brought his dog.

The king and his soldiers were in the jungle. Suddenly, the dog was barking then ran very fast. The king ordered his soldiers to follow the dog.

&quot;Hurry! Maybe the dog is chasing a deer!&quot;

The soldiers immediately ran after the dog. Finally they were able to flnd the dog. Strangely, the dog was barking at one big stone. The soldiers carefully approached the big stone. They were surprised! They saw a baby boy was lying helplessly on the stone.

When the king arrived, he asked his soldiers.

&quot;Where&#39;s the deer?&quot; He still thought that the dog was.chasing a deer.

&quot;Your Majesty, the dog did not chase a deer. Look!&quot; one soldier pointed at the baby&quot;

The king slowly approached the baby. &quot;Bring the baby now. He is not safe here.&quot;

One soldier carefully held the baby. When they arrived in the palace, the king ordered the soldier to give the baby to Saua. She was an old woman who lived alone. :

Saua was so happy. She was lonely and she hoped that the baby boy would make her life happy. Unfortunately, Saua did not have enough bed for the baby. So she put him inside a dog cage. Because ofthat, people called the baby boy as Baroar, which means the dog cage.

Baroar grew as a handsome boy. Strangely, he exactly looked like the king&#39;s son. Baroar&#39;s Iooks and behavior were exactly the same as the prince&#39;s. People could not tell the differences betwe€n the two boys, therefore:they were always mistakenly treating him. They paid their respect to Baroar and ignored the prince.

This condition really upset the king. He really hated Baroar. He even had a bad plan. He wanted to kill Baroar during a ceremony in his palace. There would be lots of noise during the ceremony and he hoped no one would hear when the soldier killed Baroar.

&quot;Remember, you have to mark Baroar&#39;s forehead with an X sign. It&#39;s to tell you that he is Baroar and not my son!&quot; ordered the king to his loyal soldier.

The soldier understood. So he immediately went to Baroar&#39;s house. He.brought Baroar to the palace and later gave,him an X sign on his forehead. When they arrived, the prince saw Baroar with an X sign. He wanted to look like Baroar, therefore he also marked his forehead with an X sign.

When the ceremony began, the soldier saw the prince. He thought the prince was Baroar because there was an X sign on his forehead. He killed the prince! Later he buried the prince. After that he told&#39;the king that he had killed &#39;Baroar&#39;.

After the ceremony was over, the king was looking for his son. He could not flnd him. The king began restless. He had a bad feeling. He asked his soldier to go to Baroar&#39;s house. Well, the soldier found Baroar. He felt very scared. The soldier planned to kill Baroar.

Fortunately Baroar and his step mother were able to escape. The soldier followed them. Baroar and his step mother arrived at Batang Gadis River. Baroar saw one big log floating at the river. He swam and brought the log to the side of the river. He asked his step mother to sit on the log and slowly crossed the river. They arrived at the other side of the river safely.

When the soldier arrived, he could not cross the river. The water was too high. He did not have anything to cross the river.

Since then, Baroar and his mother lived in their new place. More and more people came and also lived there. When Baroar Was adult, he was chosen as their leader. Baroar became a wise king. His people really loved him. They lived happily and peacefully.</tw-passagedata>

&quot;I was your catch carp earlier, while the gold coins on the table is the embodiment of my scales.&quot; Replied the beautiful woman.

&quot;Will you be my wife O beautiful lady?&quot; Asked the young man shyly.

&quot;Well, I agreed your requirement.&quot; Said the farmer as he nodded his head.

Soon they too were married. Time passes so quickly for this happy couple. They had a son named Samosir. After the age of 6 years, he turned into a very naughty boy and difficult to be advised. His mother often told him to deliver rice to his father in the fields, but Samosir always rejected. His mother was forced to deliver his own rice for her husband at the field.

One day, as usual, Samosir told her mother to deliver rice to the fields. At first he did not want to, but because his mother kept insisting he finally went to the fields to deliver rice to his father. On the way to the field, Samosir was hungry and then eat the rice parcel for his father until empty. Samosir left only the bones of fish and then wrap it back.

Knowing the contents of the package only contains the bones of fish, then the father scolding Samosir.

&quot;Samosir!, what is this? Why in the parcel only contained fish bones? Have you eaten it? &quot;, shout his father.

&quot;Sorry dad, on the way my stomach feels hungry, so I ate your meal.&quot; Said Samosir with fear.

The father was furious then slapped his cheek, and said that his son was a child fish.

&quot;You are outrageous, son of fish!&quot;

Samosir cried because his father slapped and ran back into the house. Arriving home, Samosir asked her mother if he was completely son of a fish.

&quot;Mom ... is it true what my father said that I was his son of fish?&quot;

The mother was shocked to hear his question. She tearfully hugged Samosir and said that his father had broken his oath.

&quot;Your father broke his oath to bring the origin of your mother. Now I must return to my origin.&quot;

At that moment the sky became dark, flashing lightning followed by heavy rain. Samosir and her mother disappeared without any trace, while the former place they stand spurted heavy water. Not long after that, the place flooded to form a lake. While the father could not save himself. He died, sinking into the lake.

People then call the lake as Lake Tuba. Meanwhile, a small island located in the middle of the lake is called the island of Samosir.

The word tuba means ungrateful or has no good in returned. Over time, the community gradually call it Lake Toba.</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="22" name="Wa Lancar" tags="" position="0,319">WA Lancar was a poor young man. However he always wanted to study hard. He did not have enough money to go to a teacher. Fortunately he met a kind teacher. He was willing to teach Wa Lancar. For a return, he asked Wa Lancar to help him in the rice field. Wa Lancar agreed. The teacher taught him everything.

After several years, the teacher thought it was enough for Wa Lancar as his student. Before Wa Lancar left, the teacher gave him one advice.

“If you are hungry, don’t eat immediately, Just wait.”

Wa Lancar then left. He still wanted to study. He met the second teacher. Like the first teacher, Wa Lancar also did not have to pay. He was just asked to help the teacher in the rice field. Wa Lancar studied for several years and the teacher asked him to leave. He also gave advice to Wa Lancar.

“When you are tired walking, stop and get some rest.”

Wa Lancar still not satisfied. He met the third teacher. Again, he did not have to pay some money. He was also asked to help the teacher in the rice field. Later, it was time for him to leave. Again, the third teacher gave him an advice.

“Get a stone and a knife, and then grind the knife.”

Wa Lancar was very thankful. He wanted to help all the poor kids. He then taught them. At first, he just had few students, after that he had more and more students. And that made another teacher jealous.

The jealous teacher went to the palace and told the king that Wa Lancar taught bad lessons to the children. The king was angry. He punished Wa Lancar. The punishment was Wa Lancar had to marry the king’s daughter. Wa Lancar was scared. It was because any man who married the king’s daughter, would die mysteriously.

At the wedding reception, the guests were served with delicious foods. The jealous teacher gave Wa Lancar food. Wa Lancar remembered his first teacher’s advice, not to eat immediately when he was hungry. Wa Lancar refused the food. However the man next to him ate the food. Not long after that, the man suffered stomachache terribly. Later the man died. Apparently, the food was poisoned.

In the following morning, the jealous teacher told Wa Lancar that the king asked Wa Lancar to give the king a black stone from the hill. Wa Lancar went with some soldiers. After several hours walking, Wa Lancar was tired. He remembered his second teacher’s advice, to stop and get some rest if he was tired walking.

Wa Lancar told the soldiers to walk first. Wa Lancar was lucky. The soldiers were trapped in a big hole. Wa Lancar then took the black stone and brought it to the palace. When he arrived at the palace, Wa Lancar wanted to sleep.

Suddenly he remembered his third teacher’s advice, to grind a knife with a stone. Wa Lancar took a knife and ground it with the black stone.

After he was finished, he went to bed. He saw a centipede on the bed! He killed the centipede with his knife. His wife woke up. She heard all the noise. She was surprised to see a dead centipede on the bed.

Wa Lancar told his wife everything. He was sure that all the bad things happened because of the jealous teacher. His wife immediately told his father, the king, all the bad things. The king asked the jealous teacher if it was true. The jealous teacher could not do anything. He told everything and confessed his mistakes. The king then punished the jealous teacher.</tw-passagedata>

Then, a wedding ceremony was prepared. Everybody in the kingdom was busy. They all wanted to contribute to the wedding.

The princess was also busy preparing herself. One thing that she had to do was she had to take care of her body carefully. She wanted to look very beautiful during the wedding ceremony.

As always, the princess and her ladies-in-waiting were taking a bath in the pond inside the palace garden. The princess was so happy and she was playing around inside the pond. She was not careful and she accidentally slipped. Her nose hit a big stone and got bleeding. The ladies in-waiting immediately helped her. 

When they could stop the bleeding, they were surprised. The princess nose was no longer beautiful.When the princess knew what happened, she was very sad. She was afraid that the prince would cancel the wedding.And if that really happened, the king would be very angry. The prince was very sorry, she was not careful in the pond.

However, it was too late. There was no use for her to regret what had happened.
The princess then prayed to God.

&quot;I am not a good child, God. I cannot make my parents proud of me. Please punish me. I cannot live anymore. I don&#39;t want to see my parents being sad just because of me, prayed the princess. Amazingly, right after the princess finished praying, the princess slowly changed into a snake. It started from her legs and slowly to the upper body also changed. The ladies-in-waiting were shocked.

They went to the palace and reported to the king. When the king and the queen arrived at the pond, the princess had completely changed into a snake. The king and the queen were sad. They saw their only daughter had changed into a snake. The snake also looked very sad but she could not speak anymore.

Slowly, the snake went to the bushes and disappeared. The snake could not live in the palace anymore and could not change back as a human anymore. After all, that was her prayer to God.</tw-passagedata>

“Mother, we have to sell this. We will be very rich!” said Kantan.

“You are right. The golden stick is so beautiful. I’m sure someone is willing to pay with a lot of money. But who is going to buy this stick? All our neighbours are poor.”

“Don’t worry, mother. I will go to the other island to sell it. I will find a very rich man to buy this golden stick,” said Kantan.

Later, Kantan sailed the sea to go to Malaka Island. When he arrived there, Kantan offered the stick to merchants. But they could not pay him. Kantan asked them to pay with a lot of money.

The news spread very fast. Everybody in Malaka knew that Kantan had a beautiful golden stick. The king also heard that. He asked his soldiers to take Kantan to go his palace. The king wanted to see the stick.

“You are right. The stick is very beautiful,” said the king after Kantan showed him the stick.

The king then continued, “I want to have this stick. But I will not give you a lot of money. I will ask you to marry my daughter. You can stay here in the palace and later you can be the king to replace me,” said the king.

Kantan immediately agreed. Not long after that, they got married and stayed in the palace. Kantan was very happy and started to forget about his mother in the village.

In the meantime, Kantan’s wife always asked him about his mother. His wife really wanted to meet her mother-in-law. Kantan agreed. With a big ship, they sailed to Kantan’s hometown. When they arrived, all the villagers were surprised to see Kantan. He was a prince! They then told everyone about Kantan.

Finally, Kantan’s mother heard the news. She was very happy. When she arrived at the ship, she immediately called Kantan’s name.

“Kantan! Kantan! It’s me, I’m your mother.”

But Kantan ignored her. He was ashamed with his mother. She was an old woman and wore ragged clothes. When his wife asked, Kantan just said she was a crazy woman pretending to be his mother.

Kantan’s mother was very sad. She prayed to God. Suddenly, a big storm attacked! Big waves swallowed Kantan’s big ship. When the storm was gone, slowly an island appeared. Since then, people named the island as Kantan Island.</tw-passagedata>

The days passed by and those kids have grown into adults. Tare Iluh decided to find a job in another village. He then left his sister and his uncle.

Beru Sibou did not know the way to the village. She was lost in a jungle.

She met an old man and asked about his brother. The old man knew that there was a man in the jail because of gambling. He then suggested Beru Sibou to climb a high tree and sang a song about his brother. His brother might hear her song.

Beru Sibou then climbed a high tree. She sang a song about his brother. She sang and screamed his brother’s name.

“My brother Tare Iluh? Where are you? The villagers, please release my brother.”

Nobody listened to the song and that made Beru Sibou frustrated. She then prayed to God.

“God, I’m willing to pay my brother’s debts. I will pay with my tears, my hair, and all parts of my body can be used by the villagers. But please free my brother.”

Right after she finished praying, heavy storm attacked. And slowly Beru Sibou changed into a tree. It was just not an ordinary tree. All parts of tree were useful. Her tears changed into sweet water. Her hair changed into very strong leaves. People can use them as roofs of their houses. The fruits of the tree named kolang kaling are very delicious.

People name it as a sugar palm tree or pohon enau. People in other villages name it as pohon aren.</tw-passagedata>

In Purnama kingdom, there was a small village. Kelana Sakti and his parents lived there. Kelana Sakti was a nice boy. He was diligent and always helped his parents.

Not long after that, King Indra Sakti died. Panglima Badau then became the king. He really enjoyed his time as a king. He often had parties and neglected the people.

Soon, the kingdom was in a mess and the king only had fun at his parties. To pay all his parties, Panglima Badau asked his people to pay expensive taxes. Soldiers went to people’s house to collect the money, and that was including Kelana Sakti’s house.

“Give me your money! You have to pay the tax!” said a soldier.

“I’m sorry. I don’t have enough money. I have spent my money to buy some food,” said Kelana Sakti’s father.

“You are a liar!” The soldier then brought Kelana Sakti’s parents to the palace. Punishment for people who refused to pay the taxes was sent to jail!

“Please don’t take my parents away!” said Kelana Sakti. A soldier was angry at him and hit him. Kelana Sakti was unconscious.

When he was awake, he was inside an old man’s house.

“Where am I? Where are my parents?”

“Don’t worry. You are in my house. You are safe here. Your parents are in the palace. The king sent them to the jail,” said the old man.

<tw-passagedata pid="29" name="Mak Isun Kayo" tags="" position="286,303">ONCE upon a time in Payakumbuh, West Sumatra lived a young man named Mak Isun. He was a diligent farmer. Mak Isun always thought of how he could be richer. One day, while he was at the rice field, a man passed by. His name was Pak Soleh. He brought a monkey. He was a monkey tamer. He made money by doing peoples order to pick up the coconuts. He did not have to climb the coconut trees. He always asked his monkey to do that job.

&quot;Pak Soleh, where are you going?&quot; asked Mak Isun.

&quot;I&#39;m going to pick up some coconuts&quot;

&quot;How much do you get for the work?&quot;

&quot;That depends. If the place is near from here, I got three coconuts. But if the place is far, I get five coconut. In one day, I can get 25 coconuts,&quot; answered Pak Soleh.

Mak Isun was thinking. &quot;Hmm... if I can get 25 coconuts in one day, I could be rich. I can sell the coconuts at the market. I&#39;m sure I can get a lot of money.&quot;

&quot;Pak Soleh, do you want to sell your monkey?&quot;

&quot;This is not my monkey. This belongs to Pak Kari. I work for him. But I&#39;m not sure about my job. I heard Pak Kari wants to sell all his monkeys,&quot; replied Pak Soleh.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I will buy all hos monkeys and you can work for me later.&quot;

Then, he met Pak Kari and bought all his monkeys. He also hired all Pak Kari&#39;s employees. He told the villagers to contact him if they needed service to pick up the coconuts.

Mak Isun was right. He had a lot of money to his new business. He was richer. People then called him Mak Isun Kayo, kayo means rich.

However, Mak Isun Kayo was not satisfied. He wanted to get more money. So, he told his employees.

&quot;Now the fees of picking up the coconuts are raised. If the place is near from here, they have to pay five coconuts. And if the place is far from here, they have to pay ten coconuts,&quot; said Mak Isun.

&quot;But the villagers will not agree. Its too expensive,&quot; said one of his employees.

&quot;I don&#39;t care. They will not have a choice. I am the only one who has this business. The villagers will pay me after all.&quot;

All the employees knew that was not a wise decision. They then planned to do something.

Later in the morning, Mak Isun was surprised. He heard noise around his house. When he peeped through the windows, he saw a lot of monkeys around his house. He asked for help, but no one dared to help him. He then asked help from his employees.

&quot;We will help you, but you have to promise not to increase the fees!&quot;

&quot;OK, I promise,&quot; said Mak Isun.

The villagers were laughing. They always talked about a rich man who was surrounded by his own monkeys.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="30" name="Legend of the Clear River Village" tags="" position="292,428">ONCE upon a time in West Sumatra, a widow took her two children to a party. Her children, a boy and a girl were very happy. They wore beautiful clothes to the party. They found delicious foods, and saw many guests in the party. The children were having a great time.

There was also a traditional music show. The show crowded with people.

The children asked their mother if they could see the music show which was located a few meters away.

&quot;Yes, you two may go there. But please remember, don&#39;t go to far,&quot; said the mother.

The children ran to the stage where the music show was performed. They enjoyed the music. But they were bored just watching the show so they took a walk around the stage. They forgot their mother&#39;s message not to go too far.

Suddenly they saw a pond. The water was very clear and fresh. Because the sun was very hot, they were tempted to play in the water. So they took off their clothes and jumped into the water. They swam together happily. It felt so fresh!

Meanwhile, the party was almost over. The mother remembered her two children. She felt so desperate because she could not find them. The day turned into night. The children were still missing. The mother cried and cried. She went home without her children.

She fell asleep after a long hour of crying. And she had a dream about her children. In her dream, she met an old woman.

The old woman told her, &quot;Your children are in the pond near the party house. If you want to see them, throw a handful of rice into the pond. Your children will appear.&quot;

As soon as she woke up, she quickly ran to the pond. She also had a handful of rice in her hand. When she reached the pond, she threw the rice into the pond and she called her children&#39;s names.

The dream was true! Two big fish with beautiful colors appeared in the pond. The mother cried when she saw them. Her children turned into big beautiful fish because they disobeyed their mother&#39;s message.

The mother cried and cried again. All the people of the village cheered her up. But she was still very sad.

The village where the pond was located is now called Desa Sungai Jernih or Sungai Janiah. It is called so because the water in the pond was very clear. Desa Sungai Jernih is located in the northern part of Nagari Baso, in Kabupaten Agam, West Sumatra.

The name of the village also reminds people today in West Sumatra that it is important to obey our parents.

Today, the people of the village come to that pond because they think it is a sacred place.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="31" name="Maninjau Lake" tags="" position="167,428">THERE was a village in the foot of Tinjau Mountain. The villagers lived happily. Among the villagers there lived bujang Sembilan or nine young men. People called them bujang sembilan because they were nine brothers. Kukuban was the oldest. Their parents died a long time ago. Bujang sembilan had a youngest sister. Her name was Sani.

The head of the village was Datuk Lambatang. He was a kind and wise leader. He always took care of the villagers, especially bujang sembilan and their sister. He often visited them with his wife and his son, Giran.

Giran never missed joining his father to visit bujang sembilan&#39;s house. he wanted to meet Sani. He fell in love with her. Fortunately, Sani also loved him.

Giran told his parents. He said that he wanted to marry Sani. Datuk Limbang agreed. He would talk to bujang sembilan about the marriage after the harvest.

Meanwhile, Sani also talked to her brothers about Giran. They all agreed. And they also knew Datuk Limbatang would propose her after the harvest.

Later, harvest was coming. All the villagers were happy. They had a habit. The celebrated harvest by having pencak silat competition. It is traditional martial art. Each family sent a young man to join the competition. Kukuban was the representative from his family and Giran represented his family.

Kukuban first had a match with a young man. Kukuban won the match. He then had a match with another man. Again he won. He always won. And it was time for Giran.

Later, the two of them had an amazing match. Both of them were very skillful. At the first Kukuban underestimated Giran. He was much younger than Kukuban. But he was wrong. Giran could beat him. Kukuban lost the match!

Kukuban was very upset. He thought that Giran would give up. Especially that Giran would marry his sister. He felt that Giran humiliated him. He was waiting for the right time to revenge!

As agreed, Datuk Limbatang and his family came to bujang sebilan&#39;s house. He wanted to to propose Sani to be Giran&#39;s wife.

Surprisingly, Kukuban rejected the proposal.

&quot;No, I will not let Giran marry my sister. He was not a good man. I have a proof. In the pencak silat match, he attacked me brutally&quot;, said Kukuban.

&quot;But it was only a game. I don&#39;t think he attacked you brutally. Many people watch the match and I&#39;m sure they all agreed with me,&quot; said Dauk Limbatang.

Unfortunately, Kukuban had made up his mind. He rejected the proposal. Sani and Giran were very sad.

However both of them still met secretly.

Kukuban finally found out. He and his brothers send them to the traditional court. He accused them having a sinful relationship. And they were punished. They would be thrown to the crater of Tinjau Mountain.

&quot;We are innocent. We never do anything wrong,&quot; said Giran.

Then he prayed.

&quot;God, when we are wrong, please destroy our body in the crater. But if we are innocent, make this mountain erupt and change bujang sembilan as fish.&quot;

Then they were thrown into crater.

Not long after that, the mountain erupted. People saved their lives. Amazingly, bujang sembilan slowly turned into fish. And the crater was getting bigger. It finally became a lake. People named it as Maninjau Lake.</tw-passagedata>

Their land was fertile. And the weather was always great. And that made people from other kingdoms become jealous.

King Sitambago knew that he had to protect his kingdom. He asked all the men in his kingdom to join as soldiers. And the king prepared them to be strong soldiers.

They trained every day, days and nights. They trained a lot of skills, martial arts, and also how to use weapons. They had to be ready to fight when other kingdoms attacked them. And what King Sitambago feared finally came true. One of his soldiers told him that the soldiers of Silungkang Kingdom were going to attack them.

&quot;Your Majesty, I saw that the King of Silungkang is preparing his soldiers,&quot; explained his soldier.

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; asked the King.

&quot;Yes, Your Majesty. I also heard that they will attack us soon.&quot;

&quot;Hmm... I know sooner or later we will have to fight. Now, I want all soldiers to be ready. They can attack us at any time,&quot; said the King.

The King of Silungkang wanted to expand his kingdom. And he was really interested in Sitambago&#39;s kingdom. He had heard that the kingdom was so fertile. He hoped by conquering the kingdom he would be very rich! Silungkang was a big kingdom. It had a lot of soldiers, and they were very brave and strong. The King was greedy. He never felt enough or satisfied.

The King of Silungkang kingdom prepared the attack. And he gave his soldiers deadly weapons. The King could not wait any longer! Early in the morning they attacked Sitambago&#39;s Kingdom.

The soldiers of Sitambago&#39;s Kingdom were ready. The King led his soldiers bravely. And that made the soldiers also fearless. They fought bravely! The King of Silungkang was shocked. He thought Sitambago&#39;s Kingdom did not have many soldiers. And he also thought that the soldiers were coward! Well... he was wrong!

The King of Silungkang then ordered his soldiers to retreat. He was planning another attack. They would attack Sitambago&#39;s Kingdom from many gates. Moreover, he asked his soldiers to use their deadly weapons.

The soldiers heard their King. And that motivated them to fight. Meanwhile the King of Silungkang also ordered his soldiers not to give up!

&quot;It&#39;s time to use our deadly weapons! Use now!&quot; said the King.

Then the soldiers of Silungkang used the deadly weapons. In just a minute, soldiers of Sitambago were killed. The King did not give up. Sadly, he was also killed.

Silungkarrg&#39;s Kingdom won the war. However, they lost a lot of soldiers. The war had made them suffer. And the kingdom was in a big mess. Later they went back to their kingdom.

After the war, the people of Sitambago tried to rebuild their place. They made a living by farming. They made a lot of rice fields. And because their kingdom is in Lunto, their place is then known as Sawah Lunto. Sawah means rice fields.</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="35" name="Ngalau si Bincik" tags="" position="411,303">ONCE upon a time, there was a gambler in Payakumbuh West Sumatra. His name was Bincik. He really liked gambling. Whenever people asked him to do gambling, he was always ready. Sometimes he won a lot of money, but sometimes he lost. And when he lost all his money, Bincik did a terrible thing. With  his friends, he robbed people&#39;s houses. However he did not rob the houses in his village. Instead he went to other villages and robbed the houses.

Bincik was a short man. But he was very strong. He was never caught in his criminal action. Everybody knew that Bincik was a gambler and a robber. And people from other villages also knew about that. However they did not have the courage to fight against Bincik. So people from other villages started not to have contact with the people in Bincik&#39;s villages.

The people in Bincik&#39;s villages started to suffer. They could not do business as usual. Slowly they became poor. To solve the problem, all the villagers talk to Bincik&#39;s parents. They asked the parents to advise Bincik not to rob people&#39;s houses. Bincik really loved his parents. He obeyed his parents&#39; advice. Bincik then told his friends not to rob people&#39;s houses.

However, they rejected his idea. Especially Brewok, who really enjoyed robbing people&#39;s houses, he told other robbers to kill Bincik. Brewok had been jealous with Bincik. He wanted to replace Bincik as the head of the robbers.

Other robbers agreed. They attacked Bincik and threw him to a canyon. The robbers thought he was dead. Well, they were wrong. Bincik was unconscious but he was still alive.

Later Bincik opened his eyes. He felt he could not move his body. Suddenly, he saw a shadow. Bincit asked for help, &quot;Help! Please help me! I will do anything if you help me.&quot;

The shadow replied &quot;Really? Hmm… Ok, I will help you. And I will give great strengths. But I want you to use your strength to help me. My daughter is trapped in a cave. The mouth of the cave is covered by big stones. I want you to open the cave and free my daughter.&quot;

Bincik agreed. And suddenly he felt he was very strong. He was able to stand up and walk. He ran to the cave and in just a minute he was in front of the cave. With his power; he lifted all the big stones covering the mouth of the cave. Slowly it was opened.

Bionic found a very beautiful girl in the cave. She was a human. Bincik was very grateful to find her. He fell in love and later he married her. Bincik and his wife lived in the cave.

Bincik and his wife lived happily. But soon he missed his parents. He wanted to visit his parents in the village. After asking his wife&#39;s permission, Bincik left to his village.
Sadly, he could not find his parents. His village was in a terrible condition.

After Bincik left Brewok and his friends continued to rob. They also started robbing the houses in their own village! And they all were very cruel. They would hurt anyone who was trying to stop them. Bincik heard that his parents were dead. Brewok and his friends killed them. Bincik was angry!

Bincik used his great power to fight against Brewok and his friends. One by one, all Brewok’s friends were killed. And finally, Bincik was fighting head to head against Brewok. Bincik was too powerful. In a very short time, Brewok lost the fight.

After all the robbers were dead, the village was peaceful. Sadly, their peaceful life was soon ended. Dutch people came and they wanted to occupy their place. Bincik led the villagers to join the war. Bincik&#39;s power was very useful in war. The Dutch lost many of their soldiers. The Dutch finally knew about Bincik. They planned to kill him.

It was a massive attack. So many Dutch soldiers looked for Bincik. First they all went to Bincik’s village. They could not find him there. Then they went to the jungle, again they could not find him there. Later they heard about Bincik’s wife who lived in the cave. They hoped they could find Bincik there. Still, Bincik was missing.

Until now people did not know if Bincik was still alive or already dead. And if he was dead, people did not know Where he was buried. To commemorate Bincik&#39;s great fight against the Dutch, they named his cave as Ngalau si Bincik, ngalau means cave. And the cave is in the outskirt of Payakumbuh.</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="39" name="The Unlucky Mr. Lebay" tags="" position="11,178">Pak Lebai was a wishy-washy man. He always changes his mind before he did something. He lived in a village next to a river. Every day, he always used his sampan for travelling on the river.

One day, Pak Lebai was paddling his sampan at the river. Suddenly, he heard someone called out his name. It was his neighbor.

&quot;Pak Lebai, can you come to my house tomorrow? I will have a party&quot;, said the neighbor.

Pak Lebai was happy. He loved party because he could eat delicious food. He also could get a buffalo&#39;s head from the party. 

Still on the same day, he got another invitation. Those two party invitations made him confused.

The two parties were held at the same time, but at the different places. The two neighbors who invited him lived on different sides of the river. One neighbor lived on the east side and another one lived on the west side.

&quot;I will go to the east side. I can have two heads of buffalo. He is richer,&quot; said Pak Lebai.

On the following day, he paddled his sampan with great power to the east side. He did not want to be late and lost the buffalo&#39;s head. On the way to the party, he met some friends.

&quot;The party is awful. There are not many buffalo&#39;s heads. He is very stingy, &quot;said one of them.

&quot;I don&#39;t care. I&#39;m still going there. He is my friend. I&#39;m sure he will give me the buffalo&#39;s head,&quot; said Pak Lebai.

He immediately paddled his sampan. Right before he arrived at the east side of the river, he changed his mind. He knew the host was stingy. He thought that he would not get a buffalo&#39;s head.

So he turned back his sampan and went to the west side. Again, he paddled his sampan with great power. He did not have much time. Unfortunately, right before he arrived at the west side he met his friends again.

&quot;What are you doing here, Pak Lebai? The party is over.&quot; Pak Lebai was upset and blaming himself for being wishy-washy.

He also tired because he was paddling back and forth in the river. Later he fell asleep in his sampan. He did not realize his sampan was drifting away in the river. When he woke up, he was already in the different village.

When all his neighbors heard what happened to Pak Lebai, then they all started to call him Pak Lebai Malang or the poor Mister Lebai.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="40" name="Minangkabau" tags="" position="0,139">Do you know why the roofs of houses in West Sumatra have the shape of buffalo horns? Here is the story. Once upon a time there was a kingdom in West Sumatra. The people worked as farmers. Their lives were full of happiness. The land was fertile and the weather was always beautiful. The people also had a wise king. He always protected the people.

However, soon their happy lives would be disturbed. Majapahit, a kingdom from Java would attack them. The people were so scared. They were so restless. They went to the king to talk about it. The king tried to calm them down.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, my fellow countrymen. I know Majapahit has many soldiers. They are also great in war. If we fight them, maybe we lose. But I have an idea how to beat them,&quot; said the king.

Then he continued. &quot;We can challenge them to a buffalo fight. If their buffalo dies, we win. But if our buffalo dies, they win.&quot;

&quot;We have to make sure our buffalo will win, Your Majesty. How?&quot; asked one of the people. The king smiled.

He continued, &quot;We just need to find a strong baby buffalo.&quot;

The king then ordered his people to give him the strongest baby buffalo. After that, the strong baby buffalo was separated from his mother. They did not give any food to the baby buffalo for several days. The baby buffalo was very hungry! The baby buffalo cried and cried. He asked for food.

Then the king took two sharp knives and attached them strongly to the baby buffalo horn. Now it was time for the buffalo battle. Everyone gathered on the field. The Majapahit soldier released a big and wild buffalo out of his cage. Everyone was surprised with the size of the buffalo.

Later, the West Sumatran released their baby buffalo. The Majapahit soldiers were laughing.

&quot;Ha ha ha. It&#39;s so small. How can you win?&quot;

They did not know that the hungry baby buffalo had two sharp knives on the horn. The baby buffalo ran fast towards the big buffalo and went straight under the big buffalo&#39;s stomach to find the teat.

The knives at the baby buffalo&#39;s horns cut through the big buffalo&#39;s stomach. The big buffalo fell down to the ground and died.

&quot;Yes! We win, we win, we win!&quot; The people of West Sumatra cheered.

Then, the king changed the name of the kingdom into Minangkabau. It means &quot;victorious buffalo.&quot; That is why the roofs of the houses in West Sumatra are similar to the form of buffalo horns and the traditional headdress of the women of West Sumatra is also like buffalo horns.</tw-passagedata>

Her son&#39;s names were Utuh and Ucin. And her youngest child’s name was Diang. Everyday Mak Minah always went to the jungle to collect some fire woods. She sold the woods in the market and used the money for their daily needs. She always worked alone. Her three children were lazy and only liked to play. They never helped her.

It was already late in the evening. Mak Minah did not feel well. After selling the woods in the market, she wanted to go to bed immediately.

However dinner was not ready yet. So she asked her three children to help her. 

&quot;Utuh, Ucin, and Diang... please help me prepare the dinner&quot;, asked Mak Minah. 

Those three children ignored their mother and continued playing in the front yard. Mak Minah then forced herself to prepare the dinner.

When it was ready, she called her children to have dinner. This time they listened to Mak Minah. Sadly after they finished eating, the children did not help their mother clean the dishes. Instead, they played again. Mak Minah cried. She was so sad. It was not the first time her children did not help her and ignored her. She was so sick that she went to bed immediately.

In the morning, Mak Minah went to the riverside. There was a magical stone called Batangkup Stone. The stone had magical power. It could open and close its body like a sea shell. The stone could also talk to humans.

&quot;Batangkup Stone, please help me. I cannot hold the pains anymore. I&#39;m so sick and my children did not want to help me. They always ignored me.&quot;

&quot;Please swallow my body&quot;, asked Mak Minah.

&quot;Well, if that&#39;s what you want.. get inside. I will open my body now. &quot;

Batangkup Stone then opened its body. Mak Minah later went inside. Her long hair was still outside of the stone. In the meantime, Utuh, Ucin, and Diang woke up and felt hungry. Breakfast was not ready so they were looking for their mother. The children went here and there to find their mother. Finally they were in front of the Batangkup Stone. They saw their mother&#39;s hair. They knew their mother was inside Batangkup Stone&#39;s body.

&quot;Please open your body. Let my mother go outside,&quot; scream Diang.

&quot;No, I won&#39;t! You are not good children. You always ignored your mother and never helped her&quot;, said Batangkup Stone.

&quot;But we need her now&quot;, said Utuh.

&quot;Yes, you need her now because you are hungry. You only listed to her when you want to eat. But you never help her. You will never see your mother again!&quot; said Batangkup Stone.

Those three children were crying very loud. They knew they were wrong. But it was too late to regret. They would never see their mother again.</tw-passagedata>

&quot;No, don&#39;t cook more rice! If they really come tomorrow, we serve them the stale rice!&quot; said the merchant angrily.

Finally Prince Demang Aji and his family came. They told the merchant that there was a big storm while they were cruising in the sea.

The merchant was so angry and he ignored their explanation. He even asked them to eat the stale rice.

The merchant threw the rice on the ground.

He said, &quot;Here! Eat this rice!&quot;

Suddenly, earth was shaking. Houses were falling down on the ground. Strangely, the land where the rice was&#39;thrown slowly separated. Yes, the island was separated into two parts. Not long after that rain fell down heavily. Water filled the gap of the island. Soon, it became a small strait. People were so surprised! Later, they named the strait the Rice Strait or Selat Nasi. </tw-passagedata>

Queen Cik Sima was a brave woman. She asked her soldiers to be ready and also to fight back. The war could not be avoided. The angry prince really wanted to destroy Seri Bunga Tanjung kingdom. He commended his soldiers not to go home before they won the war.

Queen Cik Sima was so worried with the war. Many of her soldiers were dead. She was really concerned with her seven daughters. She asked some soldiers to bring her daughters. She asked soldiers to bring her daughters in a safe place in the jungle. The soldiers built a hut for the seven princesses. The queen also asked the soldiers to provide enough food until the war was over. After the soldiers were sure that the seven daughter were safe, they went back to join the war.

Queen Cik Sima never gave up. Her great spirit to defend her kingdom motivated her soldiers to do their best. Slowly, they were able to make Prince Empang Kuala pulled back his soldiers.

Queen Cik Sima thought that the prince already gave up . But she did not know that the prince was preparing a new strategy. The prince came back with more soldiers. The war continued. It lasted for months. Both sides have lost so many soldiers. And finally Queen Cik Sima was facing Prince Empamg Kuala. They were fighting!

Queen Cik Sima was a great woman She had a great skills and martial arts. The prince could not beat the queen. And finally the queen could kill the prince. Before the prince was dead, he remembered Mayang Mangurai when he first met her in Sarang Umai. He was dying and he was only able to say, &quot;Umai! Umai!&quot;

People were very grateful that the war was over. And to commemorate the war, people named the area as Dumai. It was from the last word said by Prince Empang Kuala.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="45" name="Kelayang" tags="" position="261,186">THERE was a rich merchant. He was young and handsome. In his free time, the merchant loved travelling. He enjoyed going to new places and met new people.

One day, his friend told the merchant about a beautiful pond. Local people called it Kolam Loyang, which means pond of brass. They called it brass because the water was so fresh and just liked the color of brass.

The merchant arrived at Kolam Loyang. It was at night, however the merchant could see the surrounding quite well because it was full moon.

The merchant was tired. He wanted to rest and sleep under a big tree. But before he closed his eyes, he heard some girls laughing. He looked around but he did not see anyone.

When he looked at the,pond, he saw some girls were having fun at the pond. He was so curious.

&quot;Who are they? They are so beautiful,&quot; thought the merchant.

The merchant kept on looking at the girls. Later, the girls took their scarfs that they put at the side of the pond. They wore their:carfs then flew away.

&quot;Wow! They are angels! No wonder thej&#39;are so beautifrd!&quot; screamed the merchant.

On the following night, the merchant waited for the girls. He wanted to.stg&#39;at one oi th&quot; angels&#39;scarfs. Why? Well, apparently the merchant fell in love with the angels and wanted to marry one of them.

When the angels were in the water, slowly the merchant took one scarf. Then he hid behind a big tree.

After the angels were done, they looked for their scarfs. One angel could not find hers. She was completely nervous and frightened. Without her scarf, she could not,go back to the heaven.

Finally, the other angels had to leave her. When the angel was crying for her missing scarf, the merchant showed himself.

&quot;Why are you crying?&quot; asked the merchant.

1 lost my scarf&quot; said the angel.

&quot;If I can find it, will you marry me?&quot; asked the merchant.

&quot;I will, but you have to promise not to tell anyone that I&#39;m an angel. Otn&#39;erwise,I will leave you,&quot; said the angel.

The merchant agreed. He then gave the scarf to her. After that, they got married. They lived happily.

The merchant and the angel had some children. The sons were handsome and the daughters were beautiful.

People were so amazed. They always talked about the merchant&#39;s Children. That made the merchant very proud. He was so happy to hear how people were amazed with his children. People also talked how beautiful the merchant&#39;s wife was.

Sadly, the merchant forgot his promise. He told them that his wife was actually an angel. He also told people how he met her in Kolam Loyang.

People immediately went to Kolam Loyang. They waited for angels. Unfortunately, the angels never came. Well, after one angel lost her scarf at the pond, the other angels never returned to the pond.

Meanwhile, the merchant&#39;s wife was angry at her husband. She was so disappointed to hear her husband broke his promise. She took her scarf then left her family and flew to the heaven.

The merchant really regretted it. But it was too late. His wife would never come back..

In the meantime, more and more people came to Kolam Loyang. They still hoped the angels would come back. The pond became very popular. Its name slowly changed into Keloyang,
from the words Kolqm Loyang. Now people call it Kelayang. The place is in Indragiri Hulu, Riau.</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="47" name="Anyang and the King of Fish" tags="" position="136,28">THERE was a poor boy. His name was Anyang. He often walked along the sides of Siak River singing a sad song. The song was about how he missed his mother.

Where was Anyang&#39;s mother? Well, actually she was dead. Anyang did not know it and people did not have the heart to tel Anyang that his mother had died. The last time Anyang met his mother, she said that she would go to Siak River. That was why he often went to the river to look for his mother.

The news about Anyang singing a sad song while looking for his mother had spread. Even the fish in the river knew about Anyang!

The king of fish was so touched when he heard about Anyang. So one day while Anyang was looking for his mother, the King of Fish swam to the surface of the river.

&quot;Don&#39;t be sad, Anyang,&quot; said the King of Fish.

Anyang was so surprised when he saw a big fish was talking to him.

&quot;Who are you? And how do you know my name?f&#39;

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid. !&#39;m the King of the Fish. I rule this river. I know your name because you are famous here. And I know that you are sad because you are looking for your mother. Listen, I want to be your friend. I will give you this stick. Every time you want to see me, just hit the water with this stick and I will come,&quot; said the King of Fish.

Anyang was happy. He had a new friend. So when he felt very lonely, he just hit the water with his stick. The King of Fish came and they talked for hours.

Meanwhile, the head of Siak Village wanted to adopt Anyang. Her name was Batin Perawang. She did not have any child.

Batin Perawang told Anyang that she wanted to adopt him. She also told that his mother had died. She showed him the grave. Anyang was terribly sad. He just knew that his beloved mother had died and he would never see her again.

Anyang lived in Batin Perawang&#39;s house. She took care of Anyang very well She really loved him. She taught him important lessons. She prepared him to b&#39;e the futwe leader.

Days passed by and Anyang had grown to be a great man. He was strong and also kind polite, and helpful. He still went to the river and met the King of Fish.

One day, a big ship came to Siak River. People were so scared. It was the ship of the robbers! They came to rob and stole people&#39;s wealth.

Some villagers came to Batin Perawan&#39;s house and told her that the ship was coming.

&quot;The robbers came with lots of weapons! What should we do?&quot; asked one villager.

&quot;I know what to do,&quot; Anyang interrupted. &quot;I will ask my friends in the river to help me.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean? I don&#39;t understand,&quot; said Batin Perawang, his step mother.

&#39;Don&#39;t worry, Mother. I know what to do.&quot;

He grabbed his stick and went to the river. In the river, Anyang hit the water with the stick. Later, the King of Fish came.

He said, &quot;What&#39;s the matter, Anyang? Why do you look so scared?&quot;

&#39;Do you see that ship coming here? Ifs a ship of robbers. They will rob and hurt us. Please help!&quot;

&quot;Don t worry. I will ask all the fish in this river to attack them!&quot;

<tw-passagedata pid="48" name="The Magic Traditional Drum" tags="" position="542,311">ONCE upon a time in Pelalawan Kingdom, Riau, there lived a poor fisherman with his wife and children. The fisherman had a special ability. He could cure sick people. People liked him very much. The fisherman was kind and helpful. He never asked for anything when he healed the sick people.

How did the fisherman cure the sick people? Well, he used a magic traditional drum. He spelled some magic words and then hit the magic drum harmoniously. And it always worked! The sick people were always cured after they heard the rhythm of the drum.

The fisherman got the skills from his teacher. His teacher said that the magic drum could do anything even brought back the dead people to life. However he was not allowed to do that, he could only cure sick people. If he used the drum to bring back the dead, the fisherman would die!

The fisherman was so famous. Everyday sick people always came to his house to ask for his help. Although he became very famous, the fisherman was still humble. He always did his job as a fisherman.

One day a soldier came to the fisherman&#39;s house. &quot;The king wants to see you now,&quot; said the soldier. The fisherman then followedthe soldierto go to the palace.

&quot;How can I help you, Your Majesty?&quot; asked the flsherman to the king. &quot;I heard you have a magic drum that can cure sick people. I wan you to do something for me,&quot; said the king.

&quot;What do you want me to do, Your Majesty?&quot;

The king took a deep breath. He looked at the fisherman closely then said, &quot;My daughter just died. I love her very much and I don&#39;t want to lose her. I want you to use your drum to bring my daughter back to life.&quot;

The fisherman was so shocked when he heard the king&#39;s order! &quot;I cannot do that, Your Majesty. I am not allowed to do that &quot; said the fisherman nervously.

&quot;I don&#39;t care! If you don&#39;t help me, I will hang you and all your family!&quot; yelled the king. The fisherman was speechless. He was in great dilemma. He loved his family and he did not want them to die. &quot;All right, Your Majesty... I will help you,&quot; said the fisherman weakly.

The king brought the fisherman to his daughter&#39;s bedroom. She was lying on the bed. The fisherman was sitting on her side. He spelled sorie magic words and started to hit the drum harmoniously. After a while, the princess moved her hands. Yes, the king&#39;s daughter was back to life! The king was extremely happy. He hugged his daughter.

The fisherman secretly left the palace. He went to his house and talked to his family about
the dead princess.

 &quot;I have already broken my teacher&#39;s advice and I will not see you anymore.&quot;

&quot;Can we meet you again?&quot; asked the wife sadly.

&#39;Yes, you can. During rain, please go to Selempaya River and you can see me again there,&quot; said the fisherman. He then brought his drum. He went to the river and rowed his sampan.

At the river, he dropped his drum and it was sinking. ,Slowly the fisherman disappeared. .

Days later it was raining. The flsherman&#39;s wife and her children went to the river. From a distance
they saw the image of the fisherman playing and hitting the drum. They were so happy, at least for a moment they could see him.

Until now people still believe that the fisherman still &#39;lives&#39;, in Selempaya river. They often hear the sound of the drum being played when rain falls down.</tw-passagedata>

&quot;I don&#39;t love your King. TeIl him that I don,t want to be his wife,&quot; said.the princess.

The two soldiers were upset! They knew King Aceh would hate this bad news.

And theywere right! KingAceh was so angry!

He said, &quot;Attack Gasib Kingdoml I want to give them a lesson. The princess should not reject my proposal. This is an insult!&quot;

Meanwhile, King Gasib had already anricipated the attack. He knew King Aceh hated the rejection and would attack his kingdom. He ordered Chief Gimpam to lead the soldiers to go to the border. They would stop King Aceh&#39;s soldiers to enter their kingdom.

One soldier reported to King Aceh that Chief Gimpam and his soldiers were waiting at the border. King Aceh knew how great the Chief was, so he was thinking of another way to enter the kingdom.

King Aceh asked his soldier to kidnap a villager and asked him to lead the way to Gasib&quot;Kingdom. At first, the villager refused. But then the soldier tortured him badIy. Finally&amp;evillager gave up. He showed another way to go to the kingdom.

King Aceh and his soldiers succeeded to enter the kingdom. Without any problems, the king kidnapped Princess Kaca Mayang.

The king was wise and powerful. He had a beautiful wife. Though the people lived happily, the king and the queen did not. They did.not have any children. The king was worried that there would not be a new king after he died.

After years they prayed, finally God answered their prayer. Yes, the queen r,r/as pregnaht! Both the king and the queen were extremely happy. The pilople were also excited when they knew their beloved queen was pregnant.

However there was one person who was not happy. The person was the commander of the kingdom. He secretly wished &amp;at the king would never have a child. He even had a bad plan. He would take over the kingdom when the king was very old. The commander wanted to be a king and he could not do that if there was a prince.

When the commander knew that the queen was pregnant, he went to a witch. He asked the witch to do something bad.

It was time for the queen to deliver a baby. It was so surprising. The queen did not deliver a
baby. Instead she had a fish! Yes, it was a lokan fish! The commander was so happy. His wish
came true. The witch did something terribly bad to the baby. She had previously told the commander that the fish had to be killed soon. Otherwise, the fish would change back as a human.
when the flsh was 17 years old.

When the king saw the fish, he was so confused. The commander made good use of the condition. He told the king that it was a bad sign for the kingdom. He told the king that the flsh had to be killed, otherwise something terribly bad would happen.

Sadly, the king listened to the commander very well. He asked his soldier to kill the fish. He also asked his soldier to take the queen to the jungle.

Then the soldier brought the fish and the queen to the jungle. When they arrived, the queen begged the soldier not to kill the fish. After all, the flsh was her child. The soldier felt so sorry to the queen. He did not have the heart to see her very sad. So he built a small pond for the fish.

The queen was so happy. Every day she took care of the fish. When she wanted to feed the fish, she just said, &quot;Lokan, here is your food.&quot;

Then the fish approached her and ate the food. Yes, she named the fish Lokan. The queen really loved the fish. She always talked to the fish and always told him that she was his mother.

Surprisingly, the fish always moved his body as if he understood what the queen said.

Years passed by and the fish was 17 years old. The fish slowly changed into a handsome young man. Later he knocked the door.

&quot;Who are you, Young Man?&quot; asked the queen.

&quot;Mother, it&#39;s me Lokan. I&#39;m your son.&quot;

&quot;You are Lokan?&quot; asked the queen surprisedly.

&quot;I don&#39;t understand.&quot;

&quot;Neither do I, Mother. I don&#39;t understand why I can change into a man.&quot; Lokan tried very hard to convince her that he was really her son. Finally the queen believed it.

The queen asked her son to go to the palace to meet his father. However, something bad happened to the king. The commander put him in the jail and he became the king.

Prince Lokan was angry when he knew that his father was in jail. He freed his father, but the soldiers tried to stop him. Prince Lokan did not give up. He was fighting them. And he won! Not long after that the commander came. When he knew that Prince Lokan was the son of the king, he ran away. He remembered the witch&#39;s message. When the fish changed back as a mar\he would be a very powerful man. No one could beat him! That was why he ran away.

The king was so happy when the queen told him that Prince Lokan was their son. He felt so guilty. He apologized to the queen and to the prince. The king felt so old and weak. Later he asked his prince to be the new king. The prince accepted his father&#39;s request. Since then the family and the kingdom lived happily. </tw-passagedata>

The soldier immediately went to the palace and told the king about the stone. The king knew keep the that the stonewas very valuable. He wanted to stone. He then ordered the soldier to go to Pak Garam&#39;s house.

&quot;Tell him, I want to have the stone. I will give him a lot of money and jewelries. But if he refuses it, I will send him to jail!&quot; said the king.

The soldier rushed to Pak Garam&#39;s house. He told the king&#39;s message. Pak Garam was in great dilemma. He wanted to keep the stone. But he knew the king would not give him a chance to keep the stone.

&quot;Tell .the King I will go to the palace tbmorrow morning and give the stone to him.&quot;

Pak Garam arrived at the palace. The king asked him to show the stone. He looked very happy when he saw the stone. Then he asked Pak Garam to give him the stone. Pak Garam had no any other option. He gave the stone to the king. As promised, the king gave him a&#39;lot of money and jewelries.

On the way home, Pak Garam was still thinking about the stone. Suddenly he knew the benefits of the stone. The stone gave him great lessons. And he made advice based on the lessons which the people of Sakai later said as Pak Garam&#39;s advice. There were three kinds of advice, they were: keep the secret carefully and don&#39;t open the secret until you die. The second is don&#39;t break people-s hope. When someone asks for your help, do it. The third advice is don&#39;t lie or fight the ruler. Because the ruler can do anything he likes, including punishing people.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="54" name="My Nest Is Better Than Yours" tags="" position="0,303">A quail and a weaver bird were best friends. Although they were very much different, they always helped each other. They always looked for food together. They met in the morning and looked for food until in the afternoon. At night they separated and went home to their own nest.

It was raining. The quail and the weaver bird were under a big tree. While they were waiting for the rain stop, they were talking about their nests.

&quot;My nest is great. It is very clean and strong. I made it by arranging the old leaves and the twigs. I&#39;m really comfortable living in my nest,&quot; said the weaver bird.

&quot;Well, my nest is great. It is also very strong. And I don&#39;t have to be bothered making it. I just need to find a big broken tree and I can live there,&quot; said the quail.

&quot;But compared to your nest, my nest is better,&quot; said the weaver bird.

&quot;I don&#39;t think so. My nest is better than yours,&quot; said the quail.

They kept arguing. Each of them said to have a better nest. What started as a little argument then turned to almost a fight. To prove whose nest was better, they agreed to stay in their nests.

&quot;Let&#39;s stay in my nest tonight. Tomorrow we will stay in your nest,&quot; said the weaver bird.

&quot;I agree!&quot; said the quail.

It was a late in the afternoon. They were going to the weaver bird&#39;s nest.

The nest was at a branch of a tree. It was high. The weaver bird did not have any problem reaching the nest. He was flying and in just a minute he arrived at his nest. Meanwhile the quail had problem arriving at the nest. He could not fly well. Instead, he tried to climb the tree. Finally he succeeded. He arrived at the weaver bird&#39;s nest.

The weaver bird and the quail shared the nest. They started to sleep. Suddenly, the rain fell down heavily. The wind was blowing strongly. The branches of the tree were moving back and forth. The The quail was terrified. He was afraid he would fall down.

&quot;Do something! The branch is swinging. I don&#39;t want to fall down.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. We are not going to fall down,&quot; said the weaver bird calmly.

The weaver bird continued to sleep. However, the quail could not sleep at all. He regretted his decision to spend the night at his friend&#39;s nest.

In the morning, they looked for food as usual. And in the afternoon they went to the quail&#39;s nest. And when they arrived, the weaver bird was surprised.

&quot;You live here? Under the big broken tree?&quot; asked the weaver bird.

&quot;Yes. And you don&#39;t have to worry with the wind. The tree is lying on the ground, so it won&#39;t swing.&quot;

Later, they started to sleep. Then rain was falling down heavily. Unfortunately, water was slowly approaching the nest. And they were finally wet.

&quot;I&#39;m so cold,&quot; said the weaver bird.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, you will dry soon. Let&#39;s continue sleeping,&quot; said the quail.

In the morning, the weaver bird complained about the quail&#39;s nest. The quail also complained about the weaver bird&#39;s nest. Then they realized that their life were different. Since then, they never say to have the better nest. </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="55" name="The Legend of Kemuning Flower" tags="" position="11,14">ONCE upon a time there was a wise king. He had ten beautiful daughters. His wife died a long time ago. All his daughters were named with colors.

Their name were Princess Jambon (pink), Princess Jingga (orange), Princess Biru (blue), Princess Hijau (green), Princess Kelabu (grey), etc. And the youngest was Princess Kemuning (yellow).

The king loved all his daughters. However he was too busy with his jobs as the king. He asked the servant to take care of his daughters.

His daughter became spoiled. But the youngest daughter was different. She was not spoiled. She often helped the servants. They loved her very much.

One day the king planned to go a very far place. He asked what the gifts of the daughters wanted to have. They all said great things, like jewelries or beautiful dress. However Princess Kemuning did not say anything.

&quot;How about you, dear? Do you want anything?&quot; asked the king.

&quot;I just want you to come home safely, Father,&quot; said Princess Kemuning.

The king smiled. He knew his youngest daughter had good personality.

After the king went, all the daughters were fully take care by the servants. They had problems controlling the princesses. All the princesses became more naughty and spoiled. They often asked the servants to do anything.

The servants could not do anything. Consequently they did not have time to take care of the garden. It was messy. Leaves were every where. The garden was dirty.

Princess Kemuning was sad to see the condition of the garden. She knew her father loved the garden. So she started to clean the garden. She swept the leaves.

&quot;Hey, look, we have a new servant,&quot; said Princess Jingga. And they all were laughing at her. But Princess Kemuning ignored them.

Later the king came home. He brought all the gifts.

&quot;Princess Kemuning, this green stone necklace is for you. I&#39;m sorry, I could not find the yellow one. I have tried to look for it but I did not find it,&quot; explained the king.

&quot;That is all right, Father. I love it,&quot; said Princess Kemuning.

Princess Kemuning often wore the necklace. It was very beautiful. It was matching with her yellow dress. Unfortunately, Princess Hijau were jealous.

&quot;Kemuning, the necklace is mine. The color is green, right?&quot; said Princess Hijau.

But Princess Kemuning refused to give it to her. She knew Princess Hijau already got her gift. But Princess Hijau still insisted to get it. She talked to the other sisters that they planned to do something bad.

Princess Hijau asked Princess Kemuning to play in the garden. While they were playing, suddenly suddenly she grabbed Putri Kemuning&#39;s necklace. The other sisters hit Princess Kemuning&#39;s head. They hit so hard and it made Putri Kemuning died. They all very confused, They then buried her in the garden.

Meanwhile the king was looking for all his daughters. He did not see Princess Kemuning. The daughters said that Princess Kemuning ran away. But the king did not believe them. He asked all the soldiers to find her. But they never found her.

The king was sad. He often thought about her. One day the king was in the garden . There was a tree growing. The leaves were like green stone necklace and the flowers were yellow. The flowers reminded him of Princess kemuning. He named it Bunga Kemuning or yellow flower.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="56" name="Awang Garang" tags="" position="0,428">A long time ago, there was a young fisherman in Riau. His name was Awang Garang. His job was not only fishing but he also often helped people building a new ship. Awang Garang was very skillful, that&#39;s why people always asked for his help.

One day the Sultan of Riau asked his soldiers to make him one ship. They were working days and nights. However the ship was not finished yet. The ship was always broken. The soldiers were scared. They were worried that the Sultan would be angry. They then asked Awang Garang to help them. He knew the problem. He said, &quot;You have to use three different kinds of woods.&quot;

He was right! The ship was strong. All the soldiers were very eager to finish the ship. Unfortunately, an accident happened. Awang Garang&#39;s right eye was hit by a hammer. He was so angry. He cursed the ship.

&quot;I curse you not to able to sail in the sea,&quot; cursed Awang Garang.

Then he went home. His right eye was blind. Therefore he covered his eye with a black bandage.
Finally the ship was finished. Strangely it could not go to the sea. It was still stranded on the beach. All the soldiers pushed the ship to the sea but it did not move at all. One of them remembered about Awang Garang&#39;s curse. Later they went to Awang Garang&#39;s house.

&quot;You have to help us. You cursed the ship right? Now you have to make the ship sail in the sea!&quot; said the soldier.

&quot;I will help you. But I need 37 young men along with their equipment. Besides that you also have to prepare seven pregnant woman wearing different colors of clothing. And remember, you all have to close your eyes when I&#39;m working with those 37 men.&quot;

They agreed. Later 37 young men and seven pregnant women were standing beside the ship. Awang Garang ordered the 37 seven men to find some big trees. They cut down the trees and peeled the skin. Then they put the trees under the ship. Awang Garang asked the 37 men to be ready to push the ship. He asked the seven pregnant woman to pray.

Awang Garang then screamed, &quot;Everybody, on three then you all push the ship. OK, one.. two.. three.. push!&quot;

Slowly the ship moved and it finally went to the sea. Everybody was happy. They all thanked Awang Garang.

Not long after that the seven pregnant woman delivered their baby boys. The babies grew as great soldiers. And together with Awang Garang they fought against the pirates. Because they already helped the kingdom, then the Sultan gave titles as panglima or chief. Awang Garang became Panglima Hitam Elang and the seven soldiers had titles after the name of Awang Garang and the color of the cloth their mothers were wearing. They were Panglima Awang Merah (red), Panglima Awang Jingga (orange), Panglima Awang Kuning (yellow), Panglima Awang Ungu (purple), Panglima Awang Hijau (green), Panglima Awang Biru (blue) and Panglima Awang Nila (indigo).</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="62" name="The Tiger and Durian" tags="" position="136,159">SOME people believe that besides eating meat, tigers also like eating durians. Well, how could this happen? Do you want to know the story behind this? Read on!

It happened a very long time ago. There was a village named Kemingking in Jambi. The land in Kemingking was fertile. All kinds of trees grew very well. People could find all kinds of fruits there. However, there was one favorite fruit that lots of people like. It was durian.

The durians that grew in Kemingking village were very famous. It was so delicious. Many people from other places came to Kemingking to buy the durians. And during harvest time, Kemingking was full of people from other places. To avoid their durians being stolen, the villagers often stayed in the fields days and nights. When the durians were ripe, they would fall from the trees. The durians which fell out by themselves were very delicious.

Sadly, the villagers&#39; happiness was disturbed. There was a big tiger coming to the village. The tiger was so hungry. It often attacked the villagers&#39; cattle and ate them. And when the tiger could not find any cattle, it attacked the villagers!

The villagers were restless! They reported their problem to the king.

&quot;Your Majesty, we have a big problem in our village. A tiger came and attacked our cattle. It also attacked us,Your Majesty,&quot; said one villager to the king.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I will send you my best soldier to your village. Now go home with my best soldier,&quot; said the king.

It was not difficult for the soldier to find the tiger. He immediately attacked the tiger. And the tiger fought back. The soldier used his sword. Unfortunately, the sword was broken when the soldier tried to smash the tiger&#39;s body.

Later the soldier used his spear. The tiger was so big and it had great power. And again, the spear was broken. The soldier did not have any other weapons! He ran away!

The tiger chase the soldier. And the soldier ran as fast as he could. Finally, the soldier arrived in the durian field. The field was full of fall-out durians. And when the soldier saw the durians, he had an idea.

&quot;Aha!&quot; he said.

&quot;I will use the durians as my weapons. There are so many durians here, so I don&#39;t have to worry I will run out of durians,&quot; said the soldier to himself.

The soldier immediately collected the durians. And when the tiger approached him, he threw the
tiger with the durians. The soldier threw repeatedly and the tiger could not save himself anymore. It was bleeding badly. Suddenly, the tiger talked.

&quot;Enough... I give up. Please don&#39;t kill me,&quot; begged the tiger.

&quot;OK, I will not kill you. But you have to promise that you won&#39;t disturb us again,&quot; asked the soldier.

&quot;And you have to guard the durian fields at night. When you are hungry, you can eat the durians,&quot; said the soldier.

&quot;Alright, I promise,&quot; said the tiger.

Since then the villagers in Kemingking did not have to stay at nights to guard their durians fields.   They were not worried because the tiger would guard their fields from the thieves. And until now, people believe that tigers like to eat durians. </tw-passagedata>

&quot;As long as the two of you love each other and you promise you will take care of her, yes... I will give you my blessing,&quot; said the king.

He continued, &quot;However, you cannot get married now. I am going for sailing. I have some business. You can get married after I come back.&quot;

Tuan Muda Senaning agreed. He told his crew that they would stay a bit longer. He still continued trading. And when he came to the palace, he often spent time with Tuan Muda Selat.

However, after they saw the sisters&#39; mother, young men always cancelled their plan to marry the girls. Why? It was because the girls&#39; mother was a cat!

A cat? Yes, the girls&#39; mother indeed was a cat&#39; Nobody know why the cat could have humans as her children.

The girls slowly felt very sad. They wanted to have husbands. They thought they would never get married.

The younger sister said, &#39;Let&#39;s find another mother.&quot;

The older sister agreed. Then they started their journey to find a new mother.

It was a hot day. The sun was shining brightly.

The older sister said. &quot;Look at the sun. She looks so wonderful. Let&#39;s ask her to be our mother.&quot;

The sisters called the sun. The sun looked at the two beautiful girls.

&quot;Dear Sun, you look so wonderful. Do you want to be our mother?&quot; said the older sister.

The sun was smiling. &quot;I&#39;m honored with your request. But I&#39;m not as wonderful as you think. Do you see the cloud over there? If she blocks me, I&#39;m nothing. I cannot shine brightly. why don&#39;t you ask the cloud to be Your mother,&quot; said the sun.

The sisters talked to the cloud.

&quot;Dear Cloud, you look so beautiful. You are also very powerful. You can block the sun from shining. Do you want to be our mother?&quot; asked the younger sister.

The cloud answered. &quot;Though I can cover the sun, but l&#39;m hopeless when the wind is blowing
me toward the mountain. Do you see the mountain over there? I if hit her, I will be broken into pieces. Why don&#39;t you ask the mountain to be your mother?&quot; said the cloud.

The girls came to the mountain. They said, &quot;Dear Mountain, you are very strong. We&#39;re so amazed with your big body. Do you want to be our mother?&quot;

The mountain answered. &quot;It&#39;s true that my body is very big. But there are lots of holes in my body. Do you know why? It&#39;s because of the mouse! \Mhen she is making holes in my body, I&#39;m hopeless.... I&#39;m afraid my body will be broken into pieces. Why don&#39;t you ask the mouse to be your mother,&quot; said the mountain.

The two sisters were looking for the mouse. When they found her, the two sisters immediately asked her to be their mother.

&quot;Dear Mouse, though you are small you have great power. You can make holes in the mountain&#39;s body. Do you want to be our mother?&quot; asked the older sister.

The mouse looked at the two sisters and said, &#39;You are right. My body is small and I can make holes in the mountain&#39;s body. But there is one thing you have to know. I&#39;m afraid of the cat,&quot; said the mouse.

&quot;Why?&quot; asked the younger sister.

&quot;Well.... Cat always chases me and tries to eat me. Cat moves very fast and she can also climb
easily. Trust me, the cat is much more better than I am. Why don&#39;t you ask the cat to be your mother?&quot; asked the mouse.

The two sisters were silent: They just realized that their mother was already perfect for them. They felt so embarrassed with their bad behavior.

The two sisters immediately went home and then apologized to their mother.

&quot;That&#39;s all right my children. I understand how you feel about me. I already forgive you,&quot; said the cat.

Since then the sisters and their mother lived happily. The beautiful sisters also did not care for the man who cancelled their plans to marry them. The sisters were waiting for the right men who would accept their mother as a cat. </tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="67" name="A Little Girl in the Moon" tags="" position="0,14">A long time ago in Kerinci, Jambi, there was a little girl living with her family. The little girl lived with her father, mother, brother, grandfather, and grandmother. The little girl was the youngest in the family.

The little girl was not a happy girl. She was always sad. Her family did not take care of her well. They were always busy with themselves. They did not pay attention to her.

The father and the grandfather were fishermen. Every day they went fishing and went home with a lot of fish.

They sold some of the fish and ate the rest of them. The little girl loved to eat fish.
Whenever her father and her grandfather went home, she was always anxious. She was always waiting for them to bring a lot of fish.

One day, the father and the grandfather went home with a lot of fish. They have sold some of them. They brought enough fish for the whole family. The little girl was very happy. She wanted to eat the fish for her dinner.

The little girl could not prepare the fish by herself. She could not clean and cook the fish yet. She had to wait for the fish to be ready.

&quot;Mother, I&#39;m hungry. When will the fish be ready?&quot; asked the little girl to her mother.

&quot;I&#39;m busy. Ask your father to prepare the fish,&quot; said the mother.

The little girl then talked to her father.

&quot;Father, I&#39;m hungry. When will the fish be ready?&quot; asked the little girl to her father.

&quot;I&#39;m busy. Ask your grandfather to prepare the fish,&quot; said the father.

The little girl then talked to her grandfather. &quot;Grandfather, I&#39;m hungry. When will the fish be ready?&quot; asked the little girl to her grandfather.

&quot;I&#39;m busy. Ask your grandmother to prepare the fish,&quot; said the grandfather.

The little girl then talked to her grandmother.

&quot;Grandmother, I&#39;m hungry. When will the fish be ready?&quot; asked the little girl to her grandmother.

&quot;I&#39;m busy. Ask your brother to prepare the fish,” said the grandmother.

The little girl then talked to her brother.

&quot;Brother, I&#39;m hungry. When will the fish be ready?&quot; asked the little girl to her brother.

“I&#39;m busy. Why don&#39;t you prepare it yourself,&quot; said the brother.

The little girl was sad. She cried. She was very hungry. Then she sat on the big stone. She sang a song.

&quot;Get higher the stone. Let my parents be happy.&quot;

&quot;Get higher the stone. Let my grandparents be happy.&quot;

&quot;Get higher the stone. Let my brother be happy.&quot;

Amazingly the stone was slowly getting higher. The stone was high. It could reach the moon. With just a little step, the little girl was already standing on the moon. She kicked the stone and it broke into pieces. The biggest part of the stone stayed in her village.

Since then people named the village as High Stone Village or Dusun Batu Panjang. People also said that during full moon, we can see an image of a little girl smiling to the earth.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="68" name="Putri Tangguk" tags="" position="0,428">THERE was a village in Jambi. The people were farmers. One of them was Putri Tangguk. She lived with her husband and her children.

Putri Tangguk and her husband had a very small rice field. Amazingly, the rice field was able to harvest a lot of rice. Their harvest was always abundant. They put their harvest in their big barn. They were very happy with their life.

Putri Tangguk always helped her husband in the rice field. One day, she said that she wanted to quit helping her husband. She wanted to take care of the children and mingle with the neighbours.

In the morning, Putri Tangguk wanted to cook some rice. However she could not find any rice in the kitchen. She was surprised and she felt that she just took some rice from the barn and put it in the kitchen. Then, she went to the barn. Surprisingly, there was no rice in the barn. She immediately told her husband about the missing rice.

&quot;Look! The rice is gone. Our rice is stolen!&quot; said Putri Tangguk.

Putri Tangguk and her husband immediately went to the rice field. And after they finished, they brought the rice. On the way home, rain fell down heavily. The rain made the road slippery. Putri Tangguk fell down several times.

She was really upset. Later, she asked her husband to put the rice on the road.

&quot;What for?&quot; asked the husband.

&quot;The road is slippery. If we throw the rice on the field, we can step on it. Therefore the road is not going to be slippery. Don&#39;t worry, we have an amazing rice field right?&quot; asked Putri Tangguk.

Although he did not completely agree with her idea, the husband still threw the rice in front of them. The idea worked. Every time they stepped on the rice, they did not fall down.

When they arrived home, their rice was only left a little. It was only enough for their dinner. However they were not worried. Tomorrow morning, they planned to go to their rice field and took a lot of rice. They planned to fill their barn.

Surprisingly when they arrived, their rice field was full of grass. There was no rice at all. They were really confused.

At night Putri Tangguk had a dream. An old man came to her and said, &quot;You were really ungrateful. You treated us badly.&quot;

&quot;I am one of the rice you threw away on the road. You stepped on us! The god of the rice was really angry. He decided not to give you a lot of rice anymore. You can only get a little rice,&quot; said the old man.

Putri Tangguk then woke up. She really regretted what she did. She knew it was wrong to throw away the rice but it was too late. She could only feel sorry.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="69" name="The Legend of Jambi Kingdom" tags="" position="797,325">Once upon a time, there were five villages, Tujuh Koto, Sembilan Koto, Petajin, Muaro Sebo, and Batin Duo Belas. The villagers of those five villages lived peacefully. They helped each other.

Soon, the number of villagers grew highly. The villagers thought that they needed a leader to guide them. They wanted to have a king. So, the leaders from the five villages had a meeting.
They wanted to set the criteria who could be their king.

&quot;Our king should be physically strong,&quot; said the leader from Tujuh Koto.

&quot;I agree. The king should be able to protect us from the enemies, &quot;said one leader.

&quot;Not only that. He should also be well respected by us. So, the king should be strong and have good manners,&quot; said the leader from Petajin.

&quot;Then, let’s set the criteria. I have a suggestion. The king should be strong from fire. He cannot feel the pain if we burn him,&quot; said leader from Muaro Sebo.

&quot;And he cannot feel the pain when we boil him in the hot water. If we mill him in winding machine, he will survive,&quot; said another leader.

&quot;Alright then, now every village must send one representative. Choose the best man in your village. He must be the strongest and the most respected,&quot; said one leader.

Later, the best five men were gathered in the field. All the leaders had prepared fire, a hot water, and a winding machine. The first one to come was the villager of Tujuh Koto. First he had to walk through a ring of fire. He survived! Audiences were applauding. Next he had to be boiled inside a big water jug. The water was so hot but still he survived!

Finally, he had to do the last test. He had to enter the winding machine. The machine was made of steel. The man was a bit scared. He knew his bones could break. Then, he was lying on the surface. Right after his feet were milled, he screamed in pain. The machine was stopped. He failed.

Then another contestant came forward. Unfortunately he also failed in the last test. Then came another contestant but he also failed. All the best men from five villagers failed. The leaders of the five villagers then had a meeting.

&quot;If we cannot find a king from our place, let s find from other area. They then sailed the sea. And every time they visited an island, they always looked for the best man. However, no one dared to take the tests.&quot;

Finally, they arrived in India. There was a strong man there. They met him and talked about the tests. The man was interested and they went back to their hometown.

When they arrived, the man immediately took the tests. He passed the first test. Then, he was boiled in the hot water and amazingly he survived.

And then the final test. When he was lying on the surface, everybody screamed. They were afraid the man’s bones would break just like other contestants bones.

But they were wrong. The man survived. He passed the test. All the villagers were happy. They finally had a strong king that could protect them. And they named their kingdom as Jambi.</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="71" name="Palembang" tags="" position="667,310">Once upon a time in heaven a goddess looked so restless. Her name was Putri Ayu Sundari.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter, My Daughter? You don&#39;t look so happy?&quot; asked her father.

&quot;Mmrn... nothing, Father,&quot; said Putri Ayu Sundari.

&quot;Come on, I know you. There must be something that is bothering you.&quot;

&quot;Father, I have heard from my friends that there is a beautiful river on earth. I&#39;d like to visit it. May have your permission?&quot; asked Putri Ayu Sundari.

&quot;I know you love water, My Daughter. You can have my permission to go there. But you have to be accompanied by some ladies-in-waiting. And please be careful,&quot; asked the father.

&quot;l will, Father. I will,&quot; said Putri Ayu Sundari happily.

Later Putri Ayu Sundari and some ladies-in-waiting flew to earth. It was not difficult for them to find the river. And when they arrived, Putri Ayu Sundari and her ladies-in-waiting built a house for them. They were really happy to stay there.

The name of the river was Musi River. The river was so beautiful. There were many trees growing along the sides of the river. Putri Ayu Sundari often had fun in the river.

When Putri Ayu Sundari arrived and stayed near Musi River, there were no humans staying there. However Putri Ayu Sundari often saw ships cruising in the river. And when the people in the ships saw a house near the river, most of them stopped for a while.

The people also loved the place. And some of them decided to stay and build houses. More and more people came. And finally it became a small village.

Putri Ayu Sundari lived happily with the humans. They did not know that she was a goddess.

One day, a big ship came. Actually the ship was on their journey and did not plan to stop at Musi River. However someone was sick and they needed some medication immediately.

&quot;Who is the leader of this place?&quot; asked someone from the ship.

&quot;We don&#39;t have a leader. But there is a lady who is the first person to live here. And we really respect her,&quot; explained the villager.

&quot;Bring me to her.&quot;

The villager showed Putri Ayu Sundari&#39;s house to them.

&quot;Our prince is terribly ill. And we need your permission to stay here and treat him until he gets well,&quot; explained a man.

He was a soldier.

&quot;That&#39;s alright. You can stay here,&quot; said Putri Ayu Sundari.

She really felt sorry for the prince. She did not only let him stay in her house but also healed him. She knew some leaves that could be used for medication.

Slowly the prince got well. He was really thankful to Putri Ayu Sundari. He was really amazed with her knowledge in healing people. Although the prince was totally cured, he did not show any signs that he would leave the place and went home. Why? Well, the prince fell in love with Putri Ayu Sundari.

Fortunately, she also felt same feeling. Putri Ayu Sundari also fell in love with the prince. Later he proposed her to get married. The prince and his soldiers later lived there. And the prince also named the place as Lembang. The name was from the old Malay language which means the low land. And when people wanted to go there, they always said Pa Lembang. Pa means the area or location. And now the place is known as Palembang.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="72" name="The Wild Crocodile" tags="" position="261,53">Help!!! Please help me!!!&quot; a man was screaming for help. 

&quot;What&#39;s the matter? What&#39;s wrong?&quot; 

&quot;The crocodiles are attacking and eating my cows. Please help me!&quot; begged the man.

&quot;Help you? No one can help you. No one dares to handle the crocodiles.&quot;

&quot;But all my cows will be gone if no one helps me,&quot; the man looked so sad.

&quot;I know.... It happened to me too. The crocodiles ate my cattle. Now I don&#39;t have anything left,&quot; he said sadly.

&quot;We have to do something. Otherwise the crocodiles will eat all our cattle. And when all the cattle are gone, the crocodiles will eat us!&quot;

&quot;Hey, you are absolutely right. This crocodile problem has bothered us a lot. We have to tell the king about this.&quot;

&quot;I agree. Let&#39;s go to the palace and talk to the king about these crocodiles.&quot;

And those two men were going to the palace. They wanted to tell the king that the crocodiles that lived in the Musi River were dangerous. When they were hungry, the crocodiles always ate people&#39;s cattle. The people were upset. But there was nothing they could do. Everybody was scared of the crocodiles.

The two men arrived at the palace. They talked about their problem to the king.

&quot;I understand how you feel. We have to do something to make the crocodiles stop their wild behavior. We have to tame them. We need a tamer,&quot; said the king.

The king&#39;s advisor talked, &quot;Your Majesty, I know a good tamer. He can tame even the wildest crocodiles. But he lives very far from here.&quot;

&quot;Pick him up now. Go with some soldiers and when you meet the tamer, tell that I will give him lots of gold if he can tame the crocodiles,&quot; said the king.

The king&#39;s advisor and the soldiers then went to the crocodile tamer&#39;s house. After spending several days, they finally arrived. The tamer agreed to help. Then they immediately went back. The tamer went to Musi River. He did his job very well. All the crocodiles in Musi River were tamed! They did not attack the cattle anymore. Everybody praised the crocodile tamer.

&quot;It&#39;s wonderful. You have done a great job,&quot; said the king.

&quot;Thank you, Your Majesty,&quot; said the tamer proudly.

&quot;I have another plan. I have promised to give you lots of gold if you can tame the crocodiles in Musi River, and now I will give you more gold if you can tame the crocodiles that live in a swamp in the forest,&quot; said the king.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Your Majesty. I can tame all crocodiles. Just take me there, and I will tame the crocodiles,&quot; said the tamer.

On the way to the forest, the king ordered his soldier a special mission. And when they arrived, the tamer directly did his job. He tamed all the crocodiles successfully.

&quot;I have another request. Can you make the crocodiles to be wild again?&quot; asked the king.

&quot;That&#39;s easy. I will make them even wilder than before,&quot; said the tamer.

And it worked! The crocodiles were wilder than before.

Suddenly the king said, &quot;Now!&quot; And the soldiers pushed the tamer towards the crocodiles. And the crocodiles immediately attacked and ate the tamer!

&quot;Your Majesty, I still don&#39;t understand why we pushed and let the crocodiles ate the tamer,&quot; asked one soldier.

&quot;Well, with his great ability in controlling the crocodiles, I&#39;m afraid the tamer will use it to attack us. We don&#39;t have to worry, because the crocodiles in Musi River are tamed now,&quot; said the king.</tw-passagedata>

&quot;No, Son. Dayang Bulan has died. You have to face it,&quot; said the King.

&quot;But we are sure that she is still alive. Father, please let us find her,&quot; said Prince Kuning.

The king could not stop his sons&#39; request. He finally let them find Dayang Bulan.

The two princes left the palace and started their journey. They met a man in the jungle. His name was Serincung Dabung. He looked tired.

&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; asked Prince Alit.

&quot;I&#39;m looking for my sister. Her name is Dayang Ayu. People said she was dead beeause a snake bit her. But I&#39;m sure she was kidnapped by an evil man named Malim Putih. He is the son of King Negeri Salek Alam,&quot; explained Serincung Dabung.

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m. I&#39;m a fortuneteller. I know things that most people don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;Can you help us? We&#39;re also looking for our sister. Her name is Dayang Bulan,&quot; asked Prince Alit.

Well, Serincung Dabung knew that Dayang Bulan was also kidnapped by Malim Putih&#39;s brother. His Malim Hitam. Unfortunately, Serincung Dabung did not know where the girls were kept. So, the three of them split and tried to find wherer the girls were hidden.

Prince Alit was walking. He was lost and arrived in a kingdom of genies. The king welcomed him nicety. He asked why Prince Alit was lost. He told the king that he was. looking for his sister.

The king introduced his daughter to Prince Alit. The princess was so beautiful. Prince Alit fell in love at the first sight.-He agreed to rmarry the princess.

Later the king of genies told him the palace belonged to Malim Hitam and Malim Putih. After that Prince Alit went ro the palace. With his skills he learned from his grandmother, he could easily beat the two evil princes, Malim Hitarn and Malim Putih.

Prince Alit immediately freed Dayang Bulan and Dayang Ayu. As promised, Prince Alit went back to the kingdom of genies to marry the princess. Prince Alit and his wife lived happily ever after. </tw-passagedata>

&quot;I will let you stay here and do this business. but remember, you have to share your profit. You have to give half of your profit to the kingdom,&quot; said the king.

&quot;I agree, your majesty,&quot; said Tan Bun Ann.

Since then, Tan Bun Ann often came to the palace. He met Siti fatimah several times.

He really admired her beauty. He tried to find out more about her. He asked his man to ask the people about her.

After several days, Tan Bun Ann finally got information about Siti Fatimah. He knew that she was single and the king only wanted to have a rich son in law. The information made Tan Bun Ann worked harder. he wanted to be richer.

Tan Bun Ann also approached Siti Fatimah secretly. Siti Fatimah really admired his patience and his spirit to work hard. She also fell in love with him. they secretly had a relationship. After a while, Tan Bun Ann felt it was time for him to propose Siti Fatimah. He talked to the king.

&quot;I will let you marry my daughter. But there is one thing you have to do. Give me nine big jars filled with gold,&quot; said the king.

Tan Bun Ann wrote a letter to his parents in China and told them about Siti Fatimah. The parents agreed and sent him nine big jars filled with gold. To cover the gold from the thieves, the parents put some vegetables on top of the gold.

Later, the nine big jars arrived at the pier of Musi River. Tan Bun Ann immediately looked for the jars. He was so surprised. When he opened the cover of the jar, he saw rotten vegetables. He only looked at the top of the jar. he did not search at the bottom of the jars.

&quot;Hmmm...Maybe the gold is in the second jar,&quot; thought Tan Bun Ann. Again he did not find the gold. He was so angry. He threw the jars into the river. Every time he did not see any gold in the jar, he always threw it to the river. And finally he opened the last jar. Again, he did not see any gold. This time he was so tired. He did not have any power to throw the jar into the river. Instead he smashed the jar with a big stone.

And when the jar was broken, Tan Bun Ann found the gold! He knew he made a mistake.
He immediately jumped to the river. He wanted to collect the gold.

Siti Fatimah saw what was happening. She waited for Tan Bun Ann at the river bank, but he never showed up. She was impatient. She also wanted to jump and helped him.

Before she jumped, she told her guards a message, &quot;If you see a pile of soil on the river bank, and that means it is my grave.&quot; Then she jumped into the river.

The guards waited and waited. And several days the people saw a pile of soil. The soil was getting bigger and bigger. It finally became an island. The people named it Kemaro Island. Kemaro is from the word kemarau, it means drought season. People named it that because the island is never drowned although the level of the water in the Musi River is high.</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="76" name="Putri Pinang Gading" tags="" position="542,310">A long time ago in Belitung, there were a couple of husband and wife. The husband was a fisherman. The husbands name was Pak Inda and the wife’s name was Bu Tumina. They lived alone in their house. They did not have any children.

Pak Inda always went fishing in the morning. And in one morning as always he went to the sea. On the way there, he stumbled on a stick of bamboo.

&quot;This is dangerous. Someone may get hurt with it,&quot; said Pak Inda.

He threw the bamboo to the sea. Then he continued walking. Again, he stumbled on a bamboo.

“Why are there a lot of bamboos here?” asked Pak Inda to himself.

He wanted to throw the bamboo to the sea. Before he did that, he looked at the bamboo carefully.

&quot;I think this is the same bamboo I threw awhile ago. How can it be here again? &quot;Pak Inda was confused.

He then threw the bamboo to the sea. Amazingly the bamboo kept on coming back to him. He knew that this bamboo was different from other bamboos so he brought it home. At home, Pak Inda told his wife about the bamboo. Bu Tumina suggested him to put the bamboo in a box. They put the box in their bed room. In the morning, they heard a baby crying. Pak Inda and Bu Tumina looked everywhere to find the baby. Finally they found a baby girl inside the box where they put the bamboo. However the bamboo was gone.

Pak Inda and Bu Tumina were very happy. They named the baby girl Putri Pinang Gading. Pak Inda and Bu Tumina took care of her with great love. Even though Putri Pinang Gading was their only child, they did not spoil her.

They taught her to be independent. They also taught her how to protect herself from wild animals. That was why Putri Pinang Gading grew as a great girl. One day, a giant bird attacked their village. The bird was wild. It hurt many people. Nobody dared to kill the giant bird. Putri Pinang Gading knew she had to do something. She wanted to kill the bird.

&quot;Be careful my daughter. We love you very much and we don’t want anything bad happen to you. Here, take this arrow with you. The arrow has poison and it can kill the bird. Just aim it at the bird’s heart,&quot; said Pak Inda.

He knew his daughter could do that.

She was skillful with arrows. Putri Pinang Gading then went to the village. She was waiting for the bird. The villagers were scared. They asked her to be careful. Suddenly, the giant bird was flying right above her. The bird tried to attack her. Putri Pinang Gading then prepared her arrow. She aimed at the bird’s heart.

Wooosshhh! The arrow hit the bird’s heart! The bird fell on the ground and died instantly. The villagers were very happy. They thanked Putri Pinang Gading for her great action. On the ground where the giant bird fell, bamboo plants grew. The bamboos were poisonous. Later the villagers named the area as Membalong. It means poisonous bamboos. Membalong is now a district in Bangka Belitung.</tw-passagedata>

Well, Abang Daud just smiled when he saw the old man was trying to attackhim. He underestimated the old man.

He was wrong! The old man had better martial arts than he did. In just a minute, the old man cornered Abang Daud. He gave up! Abang Daud Iost the fight. Then the old man asked him to leave the house.

Well, who was that old man? His name was Apek Long Guan. He had a martial arts school. Yes, he was a teacher of martial arts. No wonder he was so skillful.

Abang Daud.was so amazed with Apek Long Guan skills. He wanted to be his sftrdent. WelI, Apek Long Guan refused him. He knew that Abang Daud was a thief and he did not want him to misuse the skills. Abang Daud did not give up. Every day he went to Apek Long Guan&#39;s house. He begged and said that he already realized his mistake. He did not want to be a thief anymore. Abang Daud also helped Apek long Guanto do anything. Yes, Abang Daud tried to persuade Apek Long Guari. Slowly, Apek Long Guan felt sorry to him. He finally let Abang Daud to be his student.

the sound of a rooster crowing. Unfortunately one soldier heard him. He brought Abang Daud
to the palace.

Udak loved his son vet much. He always gave whatever his son asked. It made his son became a spoiled boy. One day, Udak&#39;s son asked for some mangoes.

&quot;Father, I really want to eat some mangoes. Can you get some for me?&quot;

&quot;Mangoes? It&#39;s very difficult to find mangoes now. It&#39;s not the season for mango trees to harvest. How about other fruits?&quot; asked Udak.

&quot;No, Father! I want mangoes!&quot;

Udak was so worried. His heart beat very fast. He knew there was only one mango tree that could have the fruits in any season. It was a magic tree.

Unfortunately the tree belonged to the giants! Yes, there was a familyof giants in the middle of the jungle. Everybody was scared of them. They ate animals and humans! No one dared to go to the middle of the jungle.

The son began to cry. Udak was so sad to see his son crying.

&quot;All right, I&#39;ll find some mangoes for you,&quot; said Udak.

He then left the house and went to the jungle.

It was a very hard journey and Udak could handle it. Later he arrived at the giants&#39; house. The house was so big. There lived a husband and wife of giants with their only son.

The mango tree was in the front yard. The tree had some fruits. Udak was so happy to see the fruits. He carefully climbed the tree and picked the fruits. He picked the fruits very fast. He did not want the giants to know that he stole their mangoes. It was too fast and Udak was a little careless. He dropped some of ttre fruits and that made some noise!

They some saw fruits on the ground. When they checked the tree, they saw a man was picking some fruits. The giants were angry! The father giant immediately grabbed Udak.

&quot;what should we do?&quot; asked the mother giant.

&quot;Put him in a cage. Feed him some food. After his body is gaining some weight, we will eat him! He&#39;s too skinny now!&quot;

The mother giant put Udak inside the cage. Udak was very sad. He heard their conversation. He remembered his son. He felt so sad that he would not meet him anymore. He also felt guilty by spoiling his son. He knew it was wrong to give whatever his son asked him.

Udak was crying. The giants&#39; child came to Udak. He was just a little giant. He asked Udak why he was crying. Udak $ren told him about his son and how mugh he loved him.

Udak also told him that he liked to pick-aback his son. It was a great time when Udak carried his son on his back.

It seemed that the giants&#39; child never had pick-a-back before. He asked Udak to carry him on Udak&#39;s back. Udak knew it was difftcult to carry the giants&#39; child. Alhough he was still very young but the giants&#39; child was as big as Udak.

However Udak also knew that&#39;it was his opportunity to escape. So he asked the giant&#39;s child to open the cage. When it was opened, Udak ran very fast.

Udak kept on running very fast until he reached home. Udak told his son about the grants and about the fact that he almost died. The son was so touched and felt guilty. Because of him, he almost lost his father. The son apologized. He promised to be a good son.</tw-passagedata>

He was called Umpit because he always went hunting using his blowpipe. The villagers liked him very much. Umpit often hunted the wild hogs. Those animals often destroyed the villagers’ plantation. After Umpit killed the wild hogs, the villagers gave him some money.

Pak Raje was the richest man in the village. Nobody liked him. He was very stingy. He did not like to donate his money. One day he asked Umpit to hunt the wild hogs. Umpit agreed.

It went to the jungle. Finally the blood trail stopped in a big cave. Slowly he entered the cave. Then he heard a voice.

“Who are you?”

“My name is Umpit. I’m looking for a wounded hog. I shot it using my blowpipe.”

“So, it’s you! You are the man who hurt my daughter!”

Slowly a woman appeared in front of him.

“Come, follow me,” said the woman.

She then pointed a girl. She was wounded. Her leg was bleeding.

“She was not a real hog. We are the goddess of the jungle. I will forgive you, but you have to cure my daughter.”

<tw-passagedata pid="80" name="The Legend of Pulau Kapal" tags="" position="167,310">Once upon a time, there was a very poor family in Belitung. The parents had a son. He was diligent and obedient to his parents. The father did not have his own field. He worked for his neighbor&#39;s field.

One day, the father went to the jungle. He wanted to collect some fire woods. He had been looking for some fire woods since morning and it was almost evening the father had not found woods yet. He was helpless. He wanted to go home and went back to the jungle tomorrow morning.

On the way home, suddenly he saw a very beautiful stick. It was shining brightly. The father took the stick carefully. He was very curious why the stick was shining brightly. He cleaned the stick with his shirt. And he was surprised! There were some diamonds stuck on the stick.

The father immediately brought the stick home. He showed the stick to his wife and his son. They were happy.

&quot;Let&#39;s sell the stick, Father. We can use the money to buy a piece of land. We can have our own field,&quot; said the son.

&quot;I agree. But where can we sell this stick?&quot; asked the father.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Father. I will sail the sea and go to the big city. I will sell the stick with a very big price,&quot; said the son.

The mother prepared some food for the son. She told him to be careful. The son promised he would go home with a lot of money.

The son joined a big ship. He did not have enough money so he worked on the ship. The cruise lasted for months. And finally the ship harbored in a big city. The son continued his trip to sell the stick.

He offered the stick to many people. However, they did not give him a high price. The son really wanted to sell the stick with very high price.

A rich merchant heard about the beautiful stick. He met the son and saw the stick. The merchant liked the stick very much and he really wanted to own it. He knew the son wanted to sell expensively. Therefore, he offered the son something the he could not refuse. The merchant offered him a lot of money and a big ship!

The son was extremely happy. He became a rich man. He decided to stay in the big city for a while. Later he met a girl and he, fell in love with her. They finally got married.

The son and his wife were sailing. He wanted to go home. The parents heard that their only son was coming home. They were waiting impatiently.

And when the ship harbored, they called out their son. The son&#39;s wife was curious, &quot;Who are they? Why are they calling out your name?&quot;

The son felt so ashamed with his parents. They were old and their clothes were shabby.

&quot;I don&#39;t know who they are. Guards! Ask them to go away and leave my ship!&quot; ordered the son.

The parents could not believe what they just heard. They were sad. They were crying. The mother then prayed to God.

&quot;Dear God, is he really my son? If he is my son, please punish him. He broke his promise to us and he doesn&#39;t treat us well. He doesn&#39;t admit us as his parents,&quot; prayed the mother.

God heard the prayer. Suddenly, there was a heavy storm. The rain fell down heavily. The ship lost its balance. And finally it turned upside down.

The storm stopped and the sky was clear. The ship was still in its position. Slowly the ship changed into an island. People then named the island as Pulau Kapal or the Ship Island.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="81" name="Kelingking" tags="" position="261,0">A long time ago in Bangka Belitung lived a husband and a wife. They were poor and they did not have any children yet. Days and nights they prayed to God. They really wanted to have a child.

“God, please give us a child, even though he is only as big as a little finger,” prayed the husband.
Their dream came true! The wife was pregnant.

However they were surprised when they saw the baby. He was so small. He was as big as a little finger.

“You prayed to God to give us a child, although he is as big as a little finger right? Be thankful to God. Let’s love him. How will you name him then?” asked the wife.

“You are right. We have to be grateful. Well, I will name him Kelingking,” said the husband. Kelingking means little finger or pinkie.

Time passed by and Kelingking did not grow much. His body was still physically small compared to other kids. Though he was so small, Kelingking ate like adults. He ate much food. And that made his parents really worried. They were poor and sometimes they could not eat because they had to give their food to Kelingking.

“I cannot hold it anymore. I want to put Kelingking in the jungle. Let him live there. I think he can survive,” said the father.

In the morning, Kelingking and his father went to the jungle. When they arrived, the father asked Kelingking to cut down a very big tree. When Kelingking was busy cutting down the tree, his father silently went home. The father thought that Kelingking could not cut down the big tree. The father was sure that Kelingking would be lost in the jungle. But he was wrong! In the morning Kelingking suddenly showed up in front of the house. And he brought the big tree also!

“Father, where do you want me to put this big tree?” asked Kelingking.

The father was surprised. He asked Kelingking to put the tree in the backyard. Kelingking then went inside the house. As always he ate all the food and that made his father got angry. He then had another idea.

“Kelingking, let’s go to the mountain. I need a big stone from there.”

Kelingking was an obedient kid. He followed his father to go to the mountain. When they arrived, his father pointed a big stone. The stone was as big as their house!

“I want you to bring that big stone to our house,” asked the father.

When Kelingking was trying to bring the stone, the father immediately ran home. At night, when the father was sleeping , suddenly he heard Kelingking’s voice.

“Father, I’m home. Where do you want me to put this big stone?”

This time Kelingking’s father realized his mistake. It was true that Kelingking’s body was small and he ate much food. But he was a nice kid and he had great power. With that power, they could get a job and had a lot of money. The father then apologized to Kelingking. Since then they always worked together.</tw-passagedata>

She did not have husband but she prayed to god to give her a son. She hoped her son could help her work in the rice field.

“God, please give me a son. I really want to have a son although he looks like a frog”, prayed the old woman.

God answered her pray. She was pregnant. Later the baby was born. Surprisingly the baby looked like a frog. His head and his skin were like frog’s head and skin. At first, the old woman was sad. However, later on she was grateful to god. She raised her son with great love. The baby grew as a kind man. He was very strong and obedient to his mother. People called him Bujang Katak. Bujang means a young man and Katak means a frog.

Later Bujang Katak was adult. He wanted to get married. However he did not want to marry the girl in his village. He wanted to marry one of the king’s seven daughters’!

He told his plan to his mother. She was sad. She knew that the king would reject his married proposal. But she did not want to see her son sad. And later they arrived at the palace. Bujang Katak told the king about the married proposal.

“I really appreciate your courage young man. But I can not make any decision. I will ask my seven daughters to give their opinions and decisions”, said the king.

One by one all the seven daughters talked. The first daughter didn’t say good things about Bujang Katak. She insulted him. “You are so ugly. No wonder people call you Bujang Katak. You really look like a frog. I don’t want to have a husband who looks like a frog”, said the first daughter.

The second daughter also said bad things to him. “You are very poor. I don’t want to have a poor husband”. So the other daughters talked bad things about him.

Finally the youngest daughter had her turn to talk. She was the most beautiful and kindest daughter. She didn’t say bad things about him. She accepted Bujang Katak’s married proposal! “I will marry him, Father” said the youngest daughter to the king.

Everybody was surprised. All the elders’ sisters were laughing at her. The king was shocked! He never thought that one of his daughters would marry Bujang Katak. He wanted to cancel the married. So he asked Bujang Katak to do something very difficult.

“I will let you marry my daughter but you have to build a golden bridge from your house to this palace”, said the king.

Bujang Katak and his mother went home. His mother was very sad and confused.

“How can you build a golden bridge, Son?” she asked Bujang Katak. “Don’t worry, Mother. I will pray to God to help me”, said Bujang Katak.

Then Bujang Katak prayed days and nights. One night, amazing things happened. His frog’s skin removed from his body. His head also changed. He became a very handsome man. His mother burned the removed skin. Amazingly the skin changed into gold. They had a lot of gold. Slowly they built a bridge using the gold.

Finally the bridge was built from they house to the king’s palace. The youngest daughter was very happy. Her husband was very handsome and also very rich. He had a lot of gold. All her sisters were jealous. They were even more jealous when the king asked Bujang Katak to be the new king.</tw-passagedata>

They all were beautiful but they had different personalities. The oldest and the middle daughter were lazy but the youngest daughter was diligent.

One day, their mother was terribly ill. She could be cured only by eating special leaves that cooked by magical fire. Unfortunately, the leaves and magical fire were on top of the mountain and were guarded by a snake. It was not just an ordinary snake.

The snake had magical power. The name was n&#39;Daung Snake. The oldest and the middle daughter did not want to go to the top of the mountain.

&quot;I will go there, Mother. I&#39;ll take the leaves and the magical fire for you,&quot; said the youngest daughter.

Actually she was also very scared of the n&#39;Daung Snake.

Then, after several days climbing the mountain, she finally arrived at the n&#39;Daung Snake&#39;s place. It was a cave. The special leaves and the magical fire were inside the cave. Suddenly, she heard some noises. The n&#39;Daung Snake was coming! She was very terrified but she did not want to run. She wanted to talk about her problem to the Snake.

In just a minute, the snake was already in front of her.

&quot;Who are you, young girl? What are you doing here?&quot; asked the snake politely.

She was surprised. Although the snake looked scary, he was very polite. Then, she asked the snake to give her the leaves and the magical fire.

&quot;You can take them, but you have to be my wife. Agree?&quot; asked the snake.

She did not think twice. She just wanted her mother to be cured soon. Then, the snake gave her the leaves and the torch burned by the magical fire. She directly went home.

Later, the mother got cured. The youngest daughter knew that she had to keep her promise to n&#39;Daung Snake.

So, she left the house without saying goodbye. When she arrived at the cave, it was already in the evening. She went inside the cave but she could not find the snake. She met a handsome man instead.

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid. My name is Prince Abdul Rahman Alamsjah. My uncle cursed me into a snake only during daylight. In the evening, I became a human. My uncle did not want me to be a king,&quot; explained the man.

In the meantime, her mother and her older sisters were looking for her. They finally arrived at n&#39;Daung Snake&#39;s cave. It was also already in the evening. They saw the youngest daughter was with a handsome man.

After they knew who the man was, the older sisters were jealous. They burned the snake skin. They hoped n&#39;Daung Snake could not change back as a human.

However, the result was the opposite. By burning the snake skin, the spell was broken. Prince Abdul Rahman Alamsjah was free from the curse.

He then asked his wife to go with him to the palace. He would be the next king and sent his uncle to the jail. The youngest daughter also asked her mother to stay with them in the palace. How about the older sisters? They were ashamed with their behavior, so they stayed in the cave.</tw-passagedata>

Sinatung Natak was in love with Princess Cerlik Cerilang. He told his father that he wanted to see the princess and then proposed her.

&quot;You know that she is engaged to Prince Sinatung Bakas, right? How about your illness? You still have red spots all over your body,&quot; asked the father.

&quot;I know that, Father. But my illness cannot stop my love for her.&quot;

The father knew he could not stop his youngest child to see the princess. When Sinatung Natak arrived at the palace, he told the guards that he wanted to see the princess. They allowed him. They all knew Sinatung Natak and his father.

The princess was in the palace garden. She was sitting on a big stone. She looked very sad. She was thinking of her marriage with the man whom she did not love.

Sinatung Natak came and tried to make a conversation. The princess was happy to see him. She also knew him. Later they had a nice conversation.

While they were talking, suddenly Prince Sinatung Bakas came! He was so angry to see the princess was talking to a man. Without thinking any further, he stabbed Sinatung Natak with his knife. Sinatung Natak died instantly.

The king heard the incident. He asked his soldiers to bury Sinatung Natak&#39;s body under the big stone.

Meanwhile, Batara Guru Tuo had a vision about Sinatung Natak&#39;s incident. With his supernatural power, he knew that his youngest child was killed. Then, he went to the palace with his older sons.

&quot;Your Majesty, Prince Sinatung Bakas killed my son!&quot; said Batara Guru Tuo.

&quot;Do you have any proofs?&quot; asked the king. He pretended not to know about the murder.

&quot;I do, Your Majesty. His dead body was buried under the big stone.&quot;

The king was surprised. However, there was nothing he could do when Batara Guru Tuo asked the soldiers to remove the stone and dig the land. Later they found Sinatung Natak dead body! That made the king felt so ashamed,

&quot;I&#39;m responsible for this. What do you want me to do?&quot; asked the king.

&quot;I want you to pay fine for us. Give us money equal with the number of red spots in his dead body,&quot; asked Batara Guru Tuo.

The king agreed. Later they started to count the red spots in the body. There were so many red spots. Amazingly, when they finished counting, Sinatung Natak came back to life! Not only that, the red spots were also gone. Everybody was surprised.

Batara Guru Tuo said, &quot;God helped Sinatung Natak.&quot;

Princess Cerlik Cerilang was also happy. Without the red spots, Sinatung Natak was actually a handsome man. Meanwhile Sinatung Bakas ran away, he was so scared that Sinatung Natak and his father would revenge.

After that, Princess Cerlik Cerilang and Sinatung Natak got married. They lived happily ever after.</tw-passagedata>

He said that the prince and the princess were kidnapped by the seven-headed snake. He was the king of the snake and he had many snake soldiers. The only person that could help was a young man who had great skills in martial arts and supernatural power.

<tw-passagedata pid="88" name="The Legend of Tes Lake" tags="" position="292,185">THERE was a man lived in Kutei Donok village, Bengkulu. People call him Pahit Lidah. He was named Pahit Lidah because he had magical power. Whatever he said would come true. That was why Pahit Lidah was always careful with his words.

Pahit Lidah had a son. One day Pahit Lidah left his village. He wanted to open new rice field. He asked permission to the head of the village. The head of the village gave him the permission. Pahit Lidah went alone. His son still stayed at home.

After walking for several hours, he finally found a good place for his new rice field. He brought his hoe and started using it. He dug the soil and threw it to the Air Ketahun River. He was working days and nighst and he never stopped to rest. He was very powerful. He kept on hoeing the soil and always threw it to the river.

He had been working for two days and there was a lot of land covering the river. Slowly the soil blocked the water. The soil in the river made the water did not flow smoothly.

The villagers were restless. They knew if Pahit Lidah kept on throwing the soil to the river, finally the river would totally blocked by the soil. They were afraid that the water would overflow and their village would be flooded.

The villagers then reported this to the head of the village. After he knew the problem, the head of the village sent some villagers to meet Pahit Lidah. They had to persuade him to stop working and returned home.

“If he still does not want to go home, tell him that his son is dead,” said the head of the villagers.

Later the villagers left. They finally met Pahit Lidah. As planned, they tried to persuade him to stop working. However, Pahit Lidah ignored them. Then they told him that his son was dead.

“Impossible. My son is fine. He is still alive,” said Pahit Lidah.

They villagers gave up. They went home and reported to the head of the village.

“I’m sorry, Sir. Pahit Lidah did not want to listen to us. Maybe if you tell him, he will listen to you. He really respects you,” said one villager.

“Hmmm. Alright, I will go now,” said the head of the village.

The head of the village then found Pahit Lidah still hoeing the soil. Later he persuaded Pahit Lidah.

“Pahit Lidah, let’s go home now. Your son is dead,” said the head of the village.

Pahit Lidah stopped working. He really respected the head of the village.

Then he said, “Because you said that my son is dead, now I really believe that my son is dead,” said Pahit Lidah sadly.

“So, why don’t you go home now?”

“I will, Sir. I just need to hoe the soil a little more,” said Pahit Lidah.

After that, the head of the village left him. Pahit Lidah just realized his mistake. Pahit Lidah was so sure that his son was not dead, then his son was indeed dead. He was so angry. However it was too late. He kept on hoeing and throwing the soil to the river. And finally the land completely blocked the river and it made a new lake. People named the lake as Tes Lake.</tw-passagedata>

He met the third teacher. He advised Buyung not to listen to women because it could disturb his mind.

Unfortunately that advice made Buyung andhis wife always arguing. Finally Buyung realized that it was a bad advice so he decided to find another teacher.

He said, &quot;I will give you advice and I can guarantee that you will be successful and rich if you do my advice. But you have to promise that you will not find ant other teacher.&quot;

<tw-passagedata pid="91" name="Kabelah" tags="" position="167,436">LONG time ago; there lived a husband and a wife. They were old. They did not have any children yet. Everyday they prayed to God to give them a child. Well, the husband almost gave up praying to God. He said, &quot;Dear God, we are old and we really want to have a child. Please give us a child although his body is only a half.&quot;

Amazingly not long after the husband finished praying, the wife was pregnant. Later they had a baby boy. However they were shocked when they saw their baby boy only had a half body. He only had one eye, one ear, one arm and one foot. Yes, his body was only a half!

&quot;What do you want to name him?&quot; asked the wife.

&quot;Kabelah,&quot; replied the husband. Kabelah is from the word sebelah which means one half.

They took care of Kabelah with great love. Although their son looked very much different from any other kids, they did not spoil him. Instead, they taught him how to be independent. Kabelah became sm.art, helpful, and obedient to his parents.

Kabelah was not happy with his life. His friends always made fun of him. They always said that Kabelah was a strange creature. He often cried at nights. He always prayed and asked God to give him a normal body.

One day Kabelah decided to look for God.

&quot;I want to meet God, Mother... I want to ask God to give me a normal body.&quot;

The parents could not stop him. They just wished that their son would be safe in his journey to meet God. Later Kabelah left the house happily. He was sure that he could meet God.

Kabelah arrived in a jungle. He saw an old man was sitting quietly under a big tree. He greeted the old man politely. However, the old man was angry!

&quot;Why are you disturbing me! Leave me alone!!!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry I just want to ask you where I can meet God,&quot; replied Kabelah politely.

&quot;Ha ha ha! I have been sitting here for a long time and praying to God. But God never comes to me. Now go away and stop disturbing me!&quot; yelled the old man angrily.

Kabelah left the old man sadly. He did not give up. He continued his journey to find God.

Later he met a group of beggars! They tried to rob him! But when they saw his body, they felt sorry for him and they were touched when they heard that Kabelah was trying to meet God. They finally let him go.

It was almost dark and Kabelah arrived in a cave. He was so tired and wanted to rest inside the cave. After he was sure that the cave was safe, he slept.

A loud voice woke him up! &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;I want to meet God. I want to ask God to give me a complete body.&quot;

&quot;Your wish is granted. You can have a complete body but you have to be grateful with your life. Also you have to do good things to people. You can start with the old man in the jungle and the beggars you met. TelI them that God is every where watching us. Tell them to change their bad behaviors!&quot;

A miracle happened! Kabelah&#39;s body slowly became normal. He had two eyes, two ears, two arms, and two feet. He was so happy.

Kabelah left the cave. Before he went home,t he looked for the old man and the beggars. the old man was surprised to see how Kabelah&#39;s body had changed. He accepted Kabelah&#39;s advice to behave well. The beggars were also surprised to see Kabelah. They also accepted his advice to stop their bad behavior. They no longer became beggars and started doing honest jobs.

When Kabelah arrived home, his parents were extremely happy. They thanked God very much. Since then Kabelah was always grateful with his life and his name was also changed into Syukur which means grateful.</tw-passagedata>

The king went to the well. He was ready to face the witch. However, when the king met the witch, he was extremely surprised. She was not old or wore shabby clothes, just like he had taught earlier. The witch was young and beautiful. However, don&#39;t underestimate her power. She could do anything she wanted!

The king fell in love gnd wanted to marry the witch. She agreed but she did not want the queen to live in the palace with her. The king was totally in love with the witch.

She wanted to eat a head of a man! That newhabit made the king was so frustrated. He could not provide a head of a man for the witch.

The witch was angry. She threatened the king that she would leave if the king could not give him a head of a man.

Though it was very difficult for him, the king asked his soldiers to kill a man and cut his head!

Unfortunately, it did not stop there. The witch asked more heads! That made the people very restless. They looked for help. They came to a holy man. He asked the witch to stop her bad habit. The witch refused. She challenged the holy man into a fight. Sadly, the holy man lost the fight!

The witch stopped eating a man&#39;s head when the baby was born. For a while, the life in the kingdom was calmed down. The queen did not continue her bad habit.

In the mean time, the.queen lived happily in the jungle. She lived with her son! It seemed that when the queen left the palace and went to the jungle, she was pregnant. She did not know that she was pregnant then, neither did the king.

The queen named his son Putra Mayang. He was a good son. He was obedient to his mother. The queen taught him everything. Putra Mayang grew as a powerful man. He mastered lots of skills.

One daythe queen told her son about his real father. Putra Mayang was surprised. He did not know that his father was a king. He then asked his mother&#39;s permission to go to the palace to meet his father.

Putra Mayang arrived at the palace. He saw a man was carrying a boy. The boy was crying and tried to free himself. However the man held him tightly.

&quot;Hey! What are you doing with the bo/? ts he your son?&quot; asked Putra Mayang.

&quot;No, he is not! I&#39;m going to eat him!&quot; said the man. &quot;What? Who are you?&quot; asked Putra Mayang.

&quot;I&#39;m the son of the king and the queen,&quot; said the man.

Yes, the man was the son of the king and the witch. He had grown up and the same age as Putra Mayang. Unfortunately the man inherited his mother&#39;s bad habit. He liked to eat humans! Putra Mayang asked him to free the boy. The man refused. They then had a fight. Luckily, Putra Mayang won the fight. The man died. That made the witch became very angry. She attacked Putra Mayang.

It was not a problem for him. In just&#39;a minute, the witch died. Surprisingly, the king just knew his mistake. Apparently, the witch had put a spell on him. That&#39;s why he could forget his wife and put her

<tw-passagedata pid="93" name="The New King" tags="" position="0,185">ALL the animals in the jungle were restless. They heard some humans came to the jungle to hunt them. They heard those hunters would kilt them. The hunters did not orrly kill the animals. They still did terrible things after the animals were dead such as taking off the elephants&#39; tusks, peeling the skin of tigers and snakes, cutting off the heads of deer and made them as ornaments in the walls, and other terrible things.

The king of the jungle was the lion. He called all the animals to gather in the open field. They had a meeting. The Lion tried to calm them down.

&quot;Relax... I will make sure they will not hunt us! I will fight the hunters, wish me luck!&quot;

The lion walked elegantly. He was very responsible and he always protected all the animals. That was why all the animals loved him very much.

The lion was waiting under a big tree. He spelled the humans were near him. He planned to attack the hunters. He was hiding behind the tree and when the time was perfect, he would jump and attack the hunters.

He was waiting... then he jumped! He attacked a human who walked in front.

Unfortunately, the lion did not know that there were others
humans behind him and those humans brought guns!
They shot the lion! The lion died instantly.

All the animals were sad. Without their king, they were very helpless.

They did not know what to do. They had to choose a new king.

&quot;No, not me. My body is big and I cannot move fast. I cannot protect you,&quot; said the elephant during a meetirig to choose a new king.

&quot;Not me either... No, not me.,.,&quot; all the animals refused to be the new. kirg.

Suddenly the monkey spoke. &quot;I will be your new king. Look at me! My body is the same as human&#39;s body. Well, Iknowhumansdo not have tails like I do. But compared to other animalt I really look like humans. So I can also think like humans, and that means I can protect you all.&quot;

All the animals nodded their heads. They agreed to choose the monkey as their new king. And that made the monkey very happy. He immediately ordered other animals to give him a lot of fruits. He said he needed the fruits to give him energy to think.

Days passed by and the monkey did not do anything. He just sat on the branch of trees and ate the fruits. He was just being lazy and that made other animals upset, because the hunters were already in the jungle.

The fox was the most upset animal. He wanted to give the monkey a lesson.

He planned to trick the monkey. He told the monkey that there was a tree full of delicious fruits. The monkey was so happy. He asked the direction of the tree to the fox. And after he knew it, he went to the tree.

The monkey did not know that the hunters set a trap under the tree. And when the monkey climbed the tree, he was trapped! The hunters immediately caught the monkey and put him in a cage. The fox was looking from a distance. He was laughing very hard.

&quot;Ha ha ha... you said you are clever, but in fact you are very stupid!&quot;

Since then the animals did not have any kings and they lived separately in the jungle.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="94" name="The Cat and the Tiger" tags="" position="386,53">ONCE upon a time, the animals were able to talk to one another. They talked just like humans talk to other humans. All the animals lived peacefully in the jungle. They had a king, and their king was the cat.

All animals chose the cat as their king because he had all the knowledge and the skills. He was the wisest and the cleverest animals in the jungle. Other animals became his students. The cat was a generous and kind animal. He was willing to teach them everything.

One of the cat&#39;s students was the tiger. He was the most obedient student. Whatever the teacher asked, the tiger was always, willing to do it. Days and nights, the tiger was with the cat. He wanted to master all the cat&#39;s skills. He wanted to be the best animal in the jungle.

&quot;Master,  there is one skill you haven&#39;t taught me yet,&quot; said the tiger. &quot;It’s the skill how to climb trees. You are good at climbing trees, Master. And I want to have that skill,&quot; said the tiger.

Actually, the cat had a bad feeling against the tiger. The cat did not really believe the tiger&#39;s sincerity in becoming his student. The cat did not want to teach him the skill how to climb trees. He felt the tiger would be a super animal if he mastered the skill.

The cat knew the tiger&#39;s potential. Therefore he always prolonged the tiger&#39;s request. &quot;You have to wait. You are not ready to study how to climb the tree. Let me teach you another skill.
It&#39;s how to sneak,&quot; said the cat.

In a very short time, the tiger mastered the skill. He could sneak perfectly. He was very happy. Then he asked his teacher to teach him how to climb the tree. And again the cat prolonged his student&#39;s request.

&quot;Wait, you haven&#39;t mastered the skill how to swim,&quot; said the cat. He hoped the tiger could not study the skill easily. He knew it&#39;s very difficult to swim. But the cat was wrong. Indeed, the tiger was a great animal. He could swim in just a minute.

The tiger became restless. He had a feeling his teacher did not want to teach him how to climb trees. However he just kept his feeling in his heart. And when the cat again prolonged his request to teach him how.to climb trees, the tiger became very angry.

&quot;Master, I&#39;m your best student. And not only that, I&#39;m your most obedient student compared to other animals. I&#39;m always next to you days and nights and I&#39;m willing to do anything you asked me.

But why you don&#39;t teach me how to climb trees?&quot; asked the tiger. The cat knew he could not always hide it anymore. Sooner or later he had to tell the truth. &quot;My student, I have a reason. I don’t really believe in you. I am afraid you will use the skill to do something bad,&quot; explained the cat.

&quot;What?!&quot; the tiger was angry.

&quot;Teach me now! Otherwise I will kill you!&quot;

The tiger attacked the cat. And the fight could not be avoided. The tiger was bigger and had more strengths than the cat. Slowly the cat was cornered, and he had no other choice but to save himself.

The cat ran away and when he found a big tree he immediately climbed it. The tiger chased him, but because he did not know how to climb trees, he just waited under the tree.

The tiger screamed, &quot;Wherever you go, I will chase you. And not only that! When you defecate, I will eat your feces!&quot; The tiger once heard that the cat&#39;s power was in his feces.

And it has happened until now. That&#39;s why every time cats defecates, they always bury their feces with sand or soil. They are afraid tigers will eat their feces!</tw-passagedata>

“Please be very careful, dear. If you see the crocodile near you, row your sampan as fast as you can,” said the mother.

“I will be careful, Mother. I will come back to you later. I promise you,” said Aminah.

Aminah then took her sampan. She rowed it slowly. She did not want to make any noise. She did not want the crocodile to hear her.

But she was wrong! The big crocodile was looking at her. The crocodile was swimming silently. Then... it attacked the sampan. It turned upside down. Aminah was so scared.

“Help! Somebody please help me!” screamed Aminah.

Aminah was drowned. She was unconscious. When she was awake, she was inside a big cave. She stood up and looked around. She saw something shining in the dark. When she approached it, she found a lot of jewelries. She was very surprised. Suddenly she heard a voice.

<tw-passagedata pid="96" name="Prince Amat Mude" tags="" position="275,561">THERE was a kingdom in Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam. The people were sad. Their beloved king just died. He was a great king. He loved his people very much. And he was a wise king. The king had a son. His name was Prince Amat Mude. 

Because he was still a baby, he could not become the next king. He had to wait until he was an adult. And for temporary, the king&#39;s younger brother became the king. He was Prince Amat Mude&#39;s uncle.

The uncle agreed Prince Amat Mude would become the king when he was an adult. At first everything went well, but soon the uncle changed his mind. He did not want Prince Amat Mude replaced him as the king. 

The uncle wanted to be the king until he died. The uncle had a bad plan. He asked the soldiers to bring the prince and the queen to the jungle. The soldiers felt very sorry for them. So they build a house in the jungle.

The queen raised the prince by herself. She taught all good things for her son. Soon the prince became a young man, Prince Amat Mude loved fishing. And one day he caught a lot of fish. The queen and the prince sold all the fish in the nearest village.

When they arrived in the village they met a rich merchant. He was surprised to see them. He was the king&#39;s best friend. When the king was alive, he often helped the merchant. The merchant wanted to help them. He bought all the fish and asked them to stay in his house.

At home, the merchant asked his wife to cook the fish. But when the wife cut the fish she found gold inside the fish&#39;s body. She gave all the gold to the queen and the prince. They then sold the gold and built a home in the village.

The prince continued to go fishing and he always found gold inside the fish body he caught. In just a moment the prince and the queen became very rich. They were very generous. They often helped people with their money. And soon they became very famous.

The bad king heard that there were very rich people in his kingdom. He did not know that they were the queen and the prince. He wanted to know who they were so he invited them to the palace.

When the bad king met them, he was shocked. He thought the queen and the prince are already dead. He pretended to be sorry with their condition in the jungle. He said he would let the prince to be the new king. But before that he asked the prince to help him.

The bad king&#39;s wife was ill. And the cure was the coconut fruit in a remote island. The bad king had another bad plan. He asked the prince to get him the coconut fruit. He knew the prince could not get the fruit because a dragon lived in the island.

The prince went to the island. And when he arrived, he met the dragon! The prince tried to calm down. He introduced himself and asked the dragon&#39;s permission to pick the coconut fruit. The dragon was able to talk to humans. He was the best friend of the prince&#39;s father. He was willing to help the prince get his crown back.

Together the prince and the dragon went back to the palace. The bad king was so scared when he saw the dragon. He had no other choice. The people were very happy, they knew Prince Amet Mude would become a great king like his father.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="97" name="The Dragon and The Giants" tags="" position="292,436">A long time ago, Sumatra Island was known. as Andalas Island. At the time, the island was divided into two big islands. The islands were separated by a strait. There were kingdoms in those two islands. They were Daru Kingdom and Alam Kingdom.

People in Alam Kingdom lived happily and peacefully. Their island was fertile. Trees grew very well. They also had lots of water. Their king, Sultan AIam, was wise. He led his people very well.

Meanwhile, people in Daru Kingdom did not live happily. They had trouble in growing trees. It happened because they did not have enough water, Rain did not fall regularly. Their lives were getting worse because their king, Sultan Daru, was a mean king.

Sultan Daru was jealous with Sultan AIam. He planned to attack Aiam Kingdom and occupy it. He had tried to send his soldiers to cross the strait and attack Alam Kingdom. However his soldiers were never able to cross the strait. In fact, some of them did not dare to cross the strait. Why? Well, it was because there lived a dragon in the strait. The dragon was a friend of Sultan Alam&#39; That was why the dragon always protected his friend from his enemies.

Sultan Daru was upset. He asked his advisor how to beat the dragon. The advisor said that the dragon could only be beaten by two giants. Their names were Seulawah Inong and Seulawah Agam.

&quot;Find the giants. Tell them, I will give anything they want if they can kill the dragon!&quot; ordered Sultan Daru to the soldiers.

The giants accepted the king&#39;s request. Soon, they went to the strait and the dragon heard that the giants came to kill him. So, he immediately talked to Sultan Alam.

&quot;So far, I can handle Sultan Daru&#39;s soldier. But this time is different. The giants are so powerful. If I&#39;m dead, the two islands will join as one island. You will feel an earthquake. Later, you will find lots fish in the beach. Don&#39;t take them! You have to ask your people to go to the higher grounds. The higher is the better. Climb hill or mountains,&quot; advised the dragon.

Not long after that, the giants came to the strait. at first, the fight was balance. The dragon could fight very well. However, slowly he lost his power. The giants were too powerful for him. Finally, the dragon was dead.

After the dragon was killed, Sultan Daru and his soldiers immediately crossed the strait. sultan AIam was sad when he heard that his friend was killed. He immediately asked his people to go to higher grounds.

What the dragon said was true! There was a big earthquake! Slowly, water in the sea.disappeared. Fish were on the beach! Sultan Daru, the soldiers, and the giants were happy. They were busy collecting the fish.

Suddenly big waves were coming! Sultan Daru, the soldiers, and the giants were drowned! They all were dead!

From the distance, Sultan AIam watched the incident. He was very thankful because the dragon had told him to ask his people to go to the higher ground.

Meanwhile the dragon&#39;s body slowly changed into an island. People later named it as Sabang Island.</tw-passagedata>

The old man also told her to take care of the wells and she was also asked to inform other girls who had a problem having a husband to take a bath in the seven wells.

Badariah told her parents about her dream. She said that the dream might be a clue for her to have a husband. Her parents agreed but she had to be accompanied by her father&#39;s employees. The mountain was full of wild animals, her father wanted her to be protected.

When Badariah was meditating, she had a vision about the seven wells. She stopped meditating and followed the vision. It was true! She found the seven wells. She immediately took a bath. And later she went home.

Not long after that a prince from Banten Kingdom came to propose her. The prince had heard about the beautiful Badariah. And when he finally met het he proposed her. This time the wedding was running very well. Badariah was very grateful. And as promised, she took care of the wells.

Now the area is known as Sumur Tujuh or seven wells. It is located in Serang, Banten. The wells are taken care by the descendants of Badariah&#39;s employees. Until now, many young girls who have a problem having a husband take a bath in the wells.</tw-passagedata>

However, she was very sad lately. A prince from another kingdom came and planned to marry her. His name was prince Cunihin. People did not like him. he was arrogant and mean to people. He had supernatural power. Prince Cunihin talked to the king about the marriage. The king accepted the proposal. He was afraid that Prince Cunihin would attack the kingdom if the proposal was refused.

The marriage was set. Princess Cadasari was sad. She did not have any choice. She prayed to god. And in one night she had a dream. She was in the park and a handsome man would help her.

On the following day, Princess Cadasari went to the park and waited the handsome man. While she was there suddenly an old man came to her.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter Princess? You look very sad,&quot; asked the old man.

&quot;I have a great problem. And I&#39;m waiting for someone to help me.&quot;

&quot;Maybe I can help you.&quot;

The princess was hesitant. In a dream, a handsome man would help her, but then it was an old man who offered to help her. She decided to talk about the problem to him. His name was Pande Gelang. Pande means maker and gelang means a bracelet. He made bracelets to make a living.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry princess, I can help you. Just tell prince Cunihin to find a big stone and just ask him to make a big hole in the stone. I will put my giant bracelet inside the stone, after that ask him to go through the bracelet. He will lose his supernatural power then&quot;

Princess Cadasari did it. She asked Prince Cunihin to find a big stone. And make a big hole in it. Prince Cunihin did not have any problem to make the hole. And after he did it, he put the stone in the park. It was the place where the wedding party would be held. And secretly, Pande Gelang put the giant bracelet inside the stone.

On the wedding day, people were gathered in the park. Before the ceremony was started, Princess Cadasari asked Prince Cunihin to go through the stone. Although he did not understand, Prince Cunihin still did the request.

Prince Cunihin was ready to go through the stone and the princess was waiting on the other side. And when he walked through the stone, Prince Cunihin screamed in pain. He was screaming and finally falling down on the ground. And when he got up, he saw Pande Gelang in front of him.

&quot;You did this to me...&quot; said Prince Cunihin.

Amazingly, Prince Cunihin slowly changed into an old man and Pande Gelang changed into a handsome man.

Pande Gelang then explained to princess Cadasari. He was a prince. Previously, Prince Pande Gelang and Prince Cunihin were best friend. They both were students from a great teacher. But after they finished the lesson, Prince Cunihin killed the teacher and stole Prince Pande Gelang&#39;s power. He would get his power back if Prince Cunihin would go through his bracelet.

Princess Cadasari was very happy. She then remembered her dream. It was true that a handsome man would help her. Since then, Prince Pande Gelang stayed in the palace. He helped the kingdom from bad people. Later Prince Pande Gelang and Princess Cadasari got married. The people were very happy. They were very grateful. They also named the palace as Pande Gelang.

<tw-passagedata pid="109" name="The Legend of Tanjung Lesung" tags="" position="417,185">THERE was a handsome traveler, his name was Raden Budog. He was resting under a big tree and soon he fell asleep. He had a dream. In his dream, he met a very beautiful woman. The woman was standing in front him. Raden Budog tried to touch her. Suddenly, a twig of the tree fell down and hit him. And that made him wake up from his sleep. He was upset!

Raden Budog could not forget that woman, he wanted to meet her. He traveled days and nights and never stopped to rest. And ﬁnally he arrived in a village. All of the villagers were farmers. Some girls were pounding rice in a mortar. The people called the mortar as lesung. They were busy pounding and the sound they made was like a harmony. The girls pounded the rice everyday, except Friday. Friday was a holy day for them, because it was time to pray to God.

Raden Budog enjoyed the sound. He was looking at all the girls one by one.

And suddenly, Aha! He saw the girl he met in his dream.

Raden Budog was very happy. He came closer to the girls. All the girls were afraid and they all went home. Raden Budog followed the beautiful girl.

And when the beautiful girl arrived home, Raden Budog knocked the door. An old woman opened the door.

“Who are you, young man,” asked the woman.

“My name is Raden Budog. May I spend the night in your house? I’m a traveler and I don’t have a place to stay,” said Raden Budog. He was trying to ﬁnd an excuse to stay in the house.

“My name is Nyi Siti and I live with my daughter. Her name is Sri Poh Haci. My husband passed away. If you want to spend the night here, you can sleep in the terrace. I’m so sorry, I don’t allow men to stay in my house,” said Nyi Siti.

In the morning, Sri Poh Haci woke him up.

She also gave him a glass of coffee. Raden Budog was extremely happy. He then tried to ﬁnd a way how he could stay in the village and got married with her. Later, he told Nyi Siti that he would help her in the rice ﬁeld. Nyi Siti agreed.

Days passed by and later Sri Poh Haci also fell in love with him. Then they got married.

Raden Budog still worked in the rice ﬁeld and Sri Poh Haci also continued to pound the rice in the lesung. One day Raden Budog wanted to pound the rice. He also wanted to make the good sound. However it was Friday, and he forgot that pounding rice in the lesung was not allowed on Fridays. And when he was busy making the sound, the villagers screamed.

“Hey, look! A monkey is pounding the rice!”

Slowly the villagers came closer to Raden Budog. He did not notice that all the villagers were looking at him, until one man yelled at him. “Hey, monkey! Stop it! It is Friday!”

Raden Budog did not understand why the villagers called him monkey. And when he looked at his body, he was surprised! His body was full of hair. He even had a tail. He had changed into a monkey! Raden Budog was so ashamed. He ran away to the jungle.

Since then people named the village as Lesung Village or Kampung Lesung.

And since the village is located in a cape, people then named the village as Lesung Cape or Tanjung Lesung.</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="111" name="Kabayan and A Merchant" tags="" position="511,53">ONCE upon a time in West Java, there was a village. All the villagers were farmers. The land was fertile and the people lived happily and prosperously. Well, actually not every one was rich. There was one young man who was poor. His name was Kabayan. He lived with his mother. Kabayan was not a farmer. He did not have his own rice field. To make a living, he worked for other farmers. He helped farming the rice, herding, and feeding the cattle.

Kabayan always played his flute while he was herding. He played very well and many people enjoyed listening to his playing. All the villagers loved Kabayan. He was smart, diligent, and helpful. Kabayan always helped anyone who needed his help.

There was one beautiful girl in the village. Her name was Nyi Iteung. She was the daughter of the head of the village. Kabayan was in love with Nyi Iteung. He always tried to find a way to approach to the girl.

One day Kabavan went to Nyi Iteung&#39;s house.

&quot;Hey what are you doing here, Kabayan?&quot; asked Nyi lteung&#39;s father.

&quot;Well, do you need any help? I mean do you need any help to herd your goats?&quot; asked Kabayan nervously.

&quot;No, my goats are fine,&quot; he said.

&quot;I do, Father,&quot; said Nyi Iteung. She overheard their conversation.

Well, nobody knew that Nyi Iteung secretly loved Kabayan.

&quot;l need him to build a fish pond, Father, &quot; said Nyi Iteung.

Kabayan was so happy he could be near the girl he loved. He built the fish pond happily. He did it after he worked. While he was busy making the fish pond, a man came to Nyi Iteung&#39;s house. He was a rich merchant.

&quot;I&#39;m here because I want to propose your daughter, Nyi Iteung to be my wife, Sir,&quot; said the merchant to Nyi lteung&#39;s father.

&quot;I cannot decide, it&#39;s all up to her,&quot; said Nyi Iteung&#39;s father.

Kabayan was angry. He had to find a way how he could stop the marriage. He knew he was not rich so he had to find a smart way. He was thinking hard, and then, Aha! He got an idea.

&quot;I know you are rich and you want to use your money to propose her,&quot; said Kabayan.

&quot;What can I say... I&#39;m very rich,&quot;said the merchant arrogantly.

&quot;Ha ha ha... although you are rich but you are not smart,&quot; mocked Kabayan.

&quot;Really? Let&#39;s prove it. Let&#39;s exchange questions. If I cannot answer your questions, I will give you all my money. But if you cannot answer my questions, you have to give me all your money,&quot; challenged the merchant

&quot;But I don&#39;t have any money. I only have a flute and a hat,&quot; said Kabayan.

&quot;Deal,&quot; said the merchant.

&quot;Now here is my question how far is the distance between the earth and the moon?&quot; asked merchant.

&quot;I don&#39;t know here please accept my flute,&quot; said Kabayan.

He continued ,&quot;What animal when it climbs a mountain has four legs but when it goes down it has two legs.&quot;

The merchant was thinking hard. He was upset because he did not know the answer. He gave up.

&quot;Here please accept all my money,&quot; he said angrily.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Kabayan. He walked away.

The merchant was angry.

&quot;Hey, what&#39;s the answer?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know either. Here take my hat,&quot; said Kabayan happily.

He had lots of money. He bought his own rice field and proposed Nyi Iteung. They got married and lived happily.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="112" name="Indramayu" tags="" position="511,0">WIRA Lodra was a young and handsome man. He had supernatural power. Lots of girls liked him. And one of them was Putri Kedasih. She really loved him and had tried to persuade him to marry her.

However, Wira Lodra rejected her love. He already loved a girl, her name was Darma Ayu. She was not just an ordinary girl. She was a goddess from heaven. She was so beautiful.

Wira Lodra and Darma Ayu were in dilemma. All the gods and the goddesses did not approve the couple&#39;s relationship.

&quot;You know you cannot have a relationship with a human,&quot; said one god.

&quot;I know.. . but I really love him,&quot; said Darma Ayu.

&quot;Your relationship with a human has made you sinned. You have to purify yourself from the sin,&quot; said one goddess.

&quot;What should I do?&quot; asked Darma Ayu.

&quot;We will put you in one place. There you have to lead the people. You will become their queen. And after the people live prosperously, you can go back to heaven.&quot;

Darma Ayu was sad. She really loved Wira Lodra although she knew it was wrong.

Then the gods and goddess put Darma Ayu in the riverside of Cimanuk River. There she became a queen. She led the people wisely. Slowly more and more people came. The people were prosperous.

Meanwhile, Wira Lodra was looking for Darma Ayu everywhere. He really lost her. And when he heard that lots of people lived in the sides of Cimanuk River, he went there. He heard that the place was led a by a very beautiful woman. She hoped that woman was Darma Ayu.

And he was right! The woman was Darma Ayu. The couple finally met again. They were really happy, And this time Darma Ayu forgot her punishment. She just wanted to live with Wira Lodra.

They would get married. However, before the marriage started, something happened. Putri Kedasih, the woman who really loved Wira Lodra, came. Apparently she still loved him although Wira Lodra had already rejected her.

She came and told Darma Ayu that Wira Lodra was her husband. She pointed her big belly. Well, it was just a lie. She pretended to be pregnant just to make Darma Ayu angry.

&quot;Wira Lodra is my husband. Look, I&#39;m pregnant. He is the father of my baby,&quot; said Putri Kedasih.

She succeeded. Darma Ayu was so angry.

&quot;You said that you really love me. But why did you marry someone else?&quot; asked Darma Ayu.

She was so sad that she left Wira Lodra. She came back to heaven.

&quot;No, please, don&#39;t leave me.... I still love you. I never marry her. Please come back to me!&quot; cried Wira Lodra.

Wira Lodra was so sad. And he was also very angry at Putri Kedasih. He asked her to leave and stay away from him forever.

People were always talking about the tragedy. They always talked about Darma Ayu, which slowly changed into Indramayu. ***

Indramayu Regency is a regency (kabupaten) of West Java, Indonesia. Indramayu is its capital. This regency is located on the northeastern part of West Java.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="113" name="The Blind and the Hunchback" tags="" position="42,186">TWO men were walking. They were going to the forest to collect some firewood. They were best friends and they always helped each other. Both of them were disabled. One was blind and the other one was hunchback.

&quot;Hey... slowly. Don&#39;t walk too fast. Do you forget that I&#39;m blind?&quot; asked the Blind.

&quot;Sorry, my friend. I will walk more slowly now,&quot; said the Hunchback.

The Blind was walking behind the Hunchback. He always listened to the Hunchback whatever he saw. Yes, the Hunchback became his &#39;eyes&#39; to see.

And how about the Blind? Well, although he could not see, he had a great skill in cooking. The food he cooked was so delicious, and the Hunchback was so grateful to eat the food.

And one day, they went to a party. As always, the Blind always followed the Hunchback. That day, the Blind did not cook. They planned to eat at the party. They were really starving.

They walked very slowly. The Hunchback could not walk fast like a normal person and every time he walked with the Blind he walked more slowly.

And when they arrived, the party was over. There was no food left They were very disappointed. The Hunchback blamed the Blind.

&quot;You make us walk very slowly. If we walk faster, we could arrive earlier,&quot; said the Hunchback.

&quot;What?! Are you blaming me? If you really wanted to go there, why you didn&#39;t leave me and ran there?&quot; asked the Blind.

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to hurt your feeling. Okay, I had an idea. Why don&#39;t we go to the jungle and hunting an animal? Maybe we can catch a deer,&quot; asked the Hunchback.

&quot;Good idea!&quot; said the Blind.

They prepared a rope and planned to make a trap. They waited and finally a big deer approached their trap.

Then .... Aha! The deer was trapped.

&quot;Hooray!&quot; said the Hunchback.

&quot;What happened?&quot; asked the Blind.

&quot;We caught a deer,&quot; explained the Hunchback

&quot;Now, it&#39;s your job to cook.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I will cook the most delicious food for you. I hope the deer is fat and has a lot of meat,&quot; said the Blind.

They both started to work.

The Hunchback collected some fire wood. He was so happy that he could catch a deer. He was so starving.

And finally the Blind finished cooking. The Hunchback was so hungry, and he thought that he wanted to eat the whole meat.

He had a bad idea. He wanted to make good use of his friend&#39;s weakness. His friend could not see, so he would not know where the meat was.

The Hunchback hid the meat and he gave some bones to the Blind.

&quot;Oh my God! It&#39;s so hard! What&#39;s this?&quot; asked the Blind.

&quot;It&#39;s the meat. The deer is old so the meat is hard,&quot; said the Hunchback. He was lying.

&quot;Really?&quot; said the Blind.

He did not believe the Hunchback. Because when he cooked the food, he felt that the meat was tender. But he ate the bone anyway. And he bit very hard and that made his eyes bugged out. And amazingly that made him able to see clearly.

The Blind was so happy, he was not blind anymore. But then he was angry when he saw that his best friend was enjoying the meat while he only got the bone!

He took the bone and he hit his friend&#39;s back.

The Hunchback was screaming in pain. But amazingly the hit made his back cured. He no longer had the Hunchback.

They were happy. They were normal! And the Hunchback apologized to the Blind.

He promised that he would never cheat on him again. The Blind forgave the Hunchback and they still had their friendship.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="114" name="A Monkey and a Bird" tags="" position="796,450">IT was a very hot day. A young duck was looking for some water. He did not only want to drink, but also wanted to swim. Rain had not fallen down for months and the duck terribly needed some water.

The duck did not give up. He knew he would find some water soon. He was right! From a distance he saw a small pond! He ran very fast.

Previously, he felt very weak, but when he saw the pond he felt very strong. He felt he had some extra energy to run. When he was standing at the side of the pond, he jumped and swam.

&quot;Yippee!&quot; the young duck screamed happily.

He drank, swam, and sang some songs. His voice made a big monkey woke up from his sleep. The monkey was sleeping on a branch of a tree. The tree was exactly at the side of the pond. The monkey could hear the duck clearly.

The monkey was angry.

&quot;Hey, you! What are you doing here? You are disturbing me!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Mr Monkey. I did not know I&#39;m disturbing you. Please forgive me.&quot;

&quot;Forgive you? No way, you ugly duck! You don&#39;t deserve here! I own this place. I don&#39;t want to see an ugly duck like you hanging around here. Go away!&quot;

The monkey threw some branches at the duck. Some of them hit the duck.

&quot;Okay, okay. I&#39;m leaving now,&quot; said the duck sadly. He was crying.

The duck left the pond. He was so sad when the monkey said that he was ugly.

A small bird was flying. He was so curious when a duck was walking and crying below him. He flew down and stopped in front of the duck.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter my friend? Why do you look so sad?&quot; asked the bird.

The duck stopped crying. He then told the bird about the monkey.

&quot;Hmm... I know that monkey. You know what? That monkey does not have any friends because he is arrogant  and he always thinks that he owns that pond. He doesn&#39;t want to share the pond. I think it&#39;s time for me to give him a lesson,&quot; said the bird.

Later the bird flew to the pond. He was thinking of an idea. It was dangerous, but he was sure that his plan could stop the monkey from being arrogant.

&quot;Hey, Mr Monkey! May I drink some water here?&quot; asked the bird.

&quot;No! Leave my pond now You are a small animal and I don&#39;t want to see small animals here!&quot; said the monkey.

&quot;What will happen if I don&#39;t want to leave this pond?&quot; asked the bird.

&quot;I will eat you!&quot; The monkey was so angry. He jumped and grabbed the bird.

He put the bird inside his big mouth. The bird tried to calm down. He had a plan and he would do it. He defecated and left the feces on the monkey&#39;s tongue. The monkey felt there was something strange on his tongue. It tasted so disgusting.

&quot;Yuck!&quot; He opened his mouth and the bird did not waste the opportunity to fly away. The monkey tried to clean his tongue, but the feces stuck very hard. He was looking for something and then he grabbed a piece of bamboo to clean his tongue. However, he did not know that the bamboo was sharp.

His tongue was bleeding! The monkey was screaming in pain.

&quot;Help!!! Please help me!&quot;

The bird responded, &quot;I will help you, but you have to promise to be kind to other animals and also you have to share the pond.&quot;

&quot;I promise,&quot; said the monkey.

The bird later helped the monkey. When the monkey was cured, he kept his promises. He was kind and shared the pond with other animals.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="115" name="The Legend of Lotus" tags="" position="42,436">ONCE upon a time, there was a kingdom named Umbul Wening. The king was Prabu Ranubahu. He had a very beautiful daughter. Her name was Dewi Arum. She had a strange habit. She liked to swim in a pond. She could spend hours swim­ming and forgot everything. Her parents often reminded her not to swim too long. And the king often got angry when Dewi Arum swam in the pond and neglected her duties as a princess.

Meanwhile, people lived happily. However their happy lives were disturbed when they suf­fered a terrible illness. And that made the king sad. He already asked the palace healer to heal them. Unfortunately the palace healer was also unable to heal the illness.

The king then prayed to god. Days and nights he asked god to heal the illness. And when the king was sleeping, he had a dream. An old man told the king that the illness could be healed with flowers in the pond. And the person who had to pick the flowers was Dewi Arum. However the pond was in Krendawahana jungle.

When the king woke up, he immediately called the princess. He told her about the dream and asked her to pick the flowers. Actually the king was not sure his daughter could go there. It was very far from the palace. The king then asked the ladies-in-waiting to accompany the princess.

After going through a very difficult journey, the princess and the ladies-in-waiting finally arrived in Krendawahana jungle. Nobody had ever been to this jungle before. Wild animals were everywhere. They all were really scared. They all hoped to find the pond soon and picked the flowers. They really wanted to leave the jungle immediately.

Finally, they found the pond. It was very beauti­ful. The water was very clear. For a moment, they all forgot about their mission. They were amazed by the beauty of the pond. The princess was the happiest person. She had never seen a beautiful pond like this. She swam and swam for hours. The ladies-in-waiting had tried to remind the princess. They asked her to pick the flowers and went home. Unfortunately she ignored them.

Meanwhile the king was waiting in the palace. He was very restless. He knew the people really needed the flowers to heal the illness.

The king was impatient. He could not wait any longer. He then went to the jungle to follow the princess. When the king arrived at the pond, he saw the princess swimming! The king was really angry.

“Dewi Arum! What are you doing here? Our people are dying and you are having fun swim­ming in the pond. I’ve told you many times not to neglect your duties. You are allowed to swim but you have to do your duties first. I’m really disappointed with you! You don’t deserve to be the princess and live in the palace. You deserve to live here in the pond!” said the king.

He was really angry.

Amazingly, the princess disappeared from the water. Later it appeared a beautiful flower. The king was surprised.

He regretted what he said. But it was too late. He knew his daughter could not live with him in the palace anymore. The princess had changed into beautiful flowers. And when the king brought the flower to the palace, surprisingly everybody was cured. And people were also amazed by the flowers. They named it Lotus. </tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="121" name="Pulau Mas" tags="" position="0,311">ONCE upon a time there was a prince. His name was Prince Wiralodra. He was a strong and powerful prince. It was because he had great skills in martial arts. Besides, he also had supernatural skills. The kingdom was safe from bad people. No criminals dared to do bad things. They all were afraid of Prince Wiralodra.

The numbers of people in the kingdom were continuously growing. The prince thought that the kingdom could not occupy the people anymore. He planned to open a jungle. He wanted to cut the trees and made the jungle as a new village. The prince held a meeting with his soldiers.

&quot;l want you to be ready. Tomorrow morning we will go to the jungle near this kingdom.&quot; All of his soldiers were silent. They were speechless.

&quot;Why were you so quiet?&quot; asked the prince. &quot;Come on, say something!&quot;

The soldiers were only looking at one another. It seemed that they were hoping someone would tell the prince about the jungle. Finally one of the soldiers opened his mouth and talked.

&quot;Sir, we heard that the jungle is haunted. A genie lives there.&quot; said the soldier.

&quot;What?! A genie?!&quot; asked the prince.

&quot;Yes, Sir. We heard that the genie always hurts people who come to the jungle. He does not like his jungle to be disturbed,&quot; explained the soldier.

&quot;Listen to me,&quot; said the prince. &quot;We need the jungle for our people. We have to provide new land for them. The jungle doesn&#39;t belong to the genie. It belongs to us. If he doesn&#39;t like that, he must go and leave the jungle.&quot;

&quot;But Sir, how can we ask the genie to leave the jungle?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, that is my business. I will take care of the genie by myself. Now, I want all of you to be ready. We will go to the jungle early in the morning. And once again, don&#39;t be afraid of the genie,&quot; said the prince.
On the following morning, Prince Wiralodra and his soldiers went to the jungle. And when they arrived, they set the tents for their base camp. Later they started to cut the trees.

While they were busy cutting the trees, they heard strange sound. They knew it was the sound of the angry genie. The genie was angry and he started to hurt the soldiers. The soldiers were doing their best to fight the genie. But the genie was too strong. The soldiers reported to the prince.
Prince Wiralodra immediately came to the genie.

&quot;Who are you?&quot; asked the genie.

&quot;I am Prince Wiralodra. I am here to open the jungle for our people.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t do that, it&#39;s my home.&quot;

&quot;But we also need the jungle, you can live in another place,&quot; said the prince.

The argument was leading to a fight. The prince had a great supernatural power. He used the power to fight. The genie did not know that the prince was very powerful. In just a minute, the genie lost the fight.

&quot;I don t know where to live,&quot; said the genie.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, you can live in that island over there. No one lives in that island.&quot;

Later the genie lived in the island. People often saw golden light from the island. Since then people named the island as Pulau Mas, which means Golden Island.</tw-passagedata>

Diyah Pitaloka Citraresmi was the daughter of King Maharaja Lingga Buana. The princess was very beautiful. In fact, people said that she was the most beautiful girl in ]ava.

Hayam Wuruk was the king of Majapahit. It was a very big kingdom in ]ava. King Hayam Wuruk heard about the beauty of Princess Diyah Pitatoka and he wanted to marry her. King Hayam Wuruk proposed Diyah Pitaloka as his wife.

King Maharaja Lingga Buana talked to Diyah Pitaloka about the proposal. He said that the marriage could strengthen the relationships between the two kingdoms. Diyah Pitaloka was a good daughter. She did not want to disappoint her parents. She accepted the marriage proposal.

The party would be held in Hayam Wuruk kingdom. King Maharaja Lingga Buana led the group. And according to the instruction from King Hayam Wuruk, the group would wait at Bubat field. It was in the northern part of Majapahit Kingdom.

When the group arrived at Bubat field, Patih Gadjah Mada came to them. He was the patih or the commander of Majapahit Kingdom. He had an ambition to conquer all parts of Nusantara. Sunda Kingdom had not been occupied yet. Seeing the King of Sunda Kingdom was in his I territory, Patih Gadjah Mada planned to attack them.

King Maharaja Lingga Buana told Patih Gadjah Mada that they came to Majapahit to hold a wedding party. They came not to have war. Patih Gadjah Mada ignored it. He said that King Hayam Wuruk would never marry Pitaloka. Instead Patih Gadjah Mada asked Princess Diyah Pitaloka to be King Hayam Wuruk&#39;s concubine as the symbol that Sunda kingdom surrendered to Majapahit Kingdom.

King Maharaja Lingga Buana was very angry. He felt he was being insulted. And the battle was unstoppable. Patih Gadjah Mada had more soldiers. In just a minute, his soldiers killed King Maharaja Lingga Buana&#39;s soldieis include King Maharaja Lingga Buana and Princess Diyah Pitaloka.

King Hayam Wuruk was very sad. He loved Princess Diyah Pitaloka very much. The battle at Bubat field then later was known as Perang Bubator Bubat Battle.

Gadjah Mada had a wound that he got from the Bubat Battle. People said that Princess Diyah Pitaloka hurt him during the battle. The wound was getting worse and finally Patih Gadjah Mada died.

In the meantime, the people of Sunda Kingdom were sad. They lost their king and their beautiful princess. They named their king as Prabu Wangi. Prabu means king and wangi means good smells. So, Prabu Wangi means the king whose name is beautiful because of his great efforts to defend his kingdom. The next kings of Sunda Kingdom were named Prabu Siliwangi and sili means successor. </tw-passagedata>

Anteh was more beautiful than Princess Endahwarni. She was often jealous with Anteh. However she still loved Anteh just like her little sister. The king and the queen thought it was time for princess Endahwarni to get married. A prince from a neighboring kingdom named Anantakusuma proposed the princess to marry him. The king and the queen had accepted the proposal. And it made Endahwani became very restless. She never met Anantakusuma yet.

Nyai Anteh agreed but she asked her family to stay in the palace. Princess Endahwarni did not mind with that. And since then Nyai Anteh lived in the palace.

Nyai Anteh had a pet. It was a cat. Every time Anteh was making a dress, the cat always accompanied her. Nyai Anteh was very happy that she could be back in the palace. But she did not know that prince Anantakusuma still love her. He secretly often looked at her. Although Nyai Anteh was not young anymore, she was still beautiful. And hat why the prince still loved her.

It was a beautiful evening and the moon was full. Nyai Anteh and the cat were in the garden. Nyai Anteh was weaving the dress. Suddenly the prince came to her.

&quot;Anteh, I have to tell you something. I love you and I want to marry you.&quot;

&quot;But that is impossible. I don&#39;t love you. You are married and I&#39;m also married.&quot;

Nyai Anteh was very scared. The prince was forced her to run away.

Nyai Anteh prayed, &quot;God, please help me. I don&#39;t want to live here anymore.&quot;

Suddenly moonlight covered her body. Slowly the light lifted her and the cat. The light brought them to the moon.

The prince was very shocked. He regretted his behaviour. He was very sorry but it was too late. Nyai Anteh stayed in the moon and never came back to the earth.

Led by their king, they went there and took some stars. Then, the sky became dark at night. People were sad and the gods were angry!

Batara Guru was the leader of the gods. He held a meeting. He invited Batara Narada, Batara Brama, Batara Bayu, and others. Batara Narada had an idea how to stop the monkeys. They would ask Ki Semar to help them.

Ki Semar had a great supernatural power. He could cut the top of the mountain easily. But first, he wanted to give a lesson to the naughty monkeys. They had to be punished for stealing the stars. He then set a plan with his children to trap the monkeys.

Gareng then went to the top of the mountain. He had to attract the monkeys to go down by giving them some bananas. It worked! The monkeys followed Gareng.

He waited and waited but the monkeys never came to him. He did not know that while the monkeys chased Gareng, they met a giant dragon. The monkeys had a fight with the dragon.

“Let’s steal his place,” said one of them.

“Yes! Let’s do it!” other shepherds agreed.

They took some mud and threw it to the skinny shepherds. The skinny shepherd was so sad. Still, he did not get angry. He just left them and walked away.

“Ha ha ha. Go now! You skinny boy!” they laughed at him.

Suddenly the sky became dark. There were a thunder and lightning. Heavy rain began to fall. The shepherds did not want to get wet. They had to find a better place. They finally found a big cave. The cave had sharp rocks inside it. All shepherds did not know that the cave was actually the mouth of the giant dragon. Yes, it was Baruklinting’s mouth! When all shepherds were inside the ‘cave’, suddenly one of them pushed the skinny shepherd away.

“Go out! You don’t belong here! It’s only for the big boys!”

&quot;But it was raining outside,” said skinny shepherd.

&quot;I don’t care!” then they pushed him.

The Crab said, &quot;The deceiver has deceived. That&#39;s your fate, Sir. Try feeling a little, I began to pinch the neck sir.&quot;

The Stork was fear because its neck started hardly to breath.

The mice felt threatened by the critical food shortages because when the mice go out, they will surely captured and eaten by the cat.

One day, a young mouse volunteered to go out looking for food.

But the elder mouse forbade and said, &quot;Are you tired of life? Even the bigger and more agile mouse than you had been caught.&quot;

&quot;Give me a chance. Even wait or go out have the same risk, starve to death or die after being caught,&quot; said the young mouse.

Finally the young mouse went out and brought a little bell and met the cat.

&quot;You are indeed a poor mouse that give your own life to me,&quot; said the cat.

&quot;Yes, Your Majesty. But before you eat me, do you think that you are being enslaved by the monk?&quot; said the young mouse.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; said the cat curious.

&quot;Since you came, please take a look at the monk. Now he is so lazy, while you should keep an eye on us day and night.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; said the Cat

&quot;I am here just wanted to give a little souvenir from the god for the monk, but I felt he was not fit to wear it, so I wanted to give this god&#39;s bell for you,&quot; said the young rat.

<tw-passagedata pid="141" name="The Legend of Mount Wurung" tags="" position="0,60">THERE was a beautiful village in Central Java. Trees grew very well. People were also very polite and friendly. They all lived happily and peacefully.

Though the village seemed to be perfect, there was one thing that the villagers thought it was not complete yet. There was no mountain in their village.

The villagers really wanted to have a.mountain in their village. Their land was so flat and they thought it would be wonderful if they could climb a mountain and saw the whole village from the top of the mountain.

Some of the villagers talked to the leader.

&quot;Sir, we really want to have a mountain in our village. Would you please talk to the Gods and ask them to build us a mountain?&quot;

The leader had heard how his people really wanted to have a mountain.

He said, &quot;Alright. I will meditate and pray to Gods. Let&#39;s hope they will make our wish come true.&quot;

The leader was wise. He was willing to spend his time to meditate. Not long after that, the leader heard a voice.

&quot;Why are you calling us? What do you want? &quot;asked the voice.

The leader opened his eyes. He did nor see anyone near him. He knew it was the voice of a god.

The leader said, &quot;My people really want to have a mountain in our village. They want to see the whole village from the top of the mountain. Would it be possible if you build us a mountain?&quot;

&quot;No problem. We will build you a mountain. We will do it tonight. But remember, you have to ask your people not to go out of the house while we are building the mountain. No one is allowed to see how we build the mountain. Do you understand? Early in the morning, you will see.&#39;a mountain in your village,&quot; said the voice.

The leader was so happy. He immediately announced his people not to go out of the house. All the villagers said yes. They all promised to stay at home.

After the sun set, the gods started.to build the mountain. The gods who built the mountain looked very scary. They all worked very fast. They collected some big stones and then piled them up. Slow but sure, the mountain started to stand.

However, while the gods were busy building the mountain, a girl left her house. She brought some rice and planned to wash it in the river.

Apparently, the girl did not know about the announcement. She was not at the village when the leader told the villagers to stay at home. While the girl was walking, she saw the mountain!

&quot;Hey, what happened here? Why is there a mountain here?&quot; The girl looked around and then she saw the gods were working.

The girl was screaming. She was so scared to see the gods who looked very scary.

&quot;Heeelllpppppp..,&quot; the girl screamed.

She kept on screaming and finally the gods heard it. They all were angry when they saw. a human.

One of the gods said, &quot;The humans broke their promise! Let&#39;s leave this place!&quot;

Soon, all the gods left the village. What about the mountain? Well, the mountain was not finished yet. The gods had not built the top of the mountain. Therefore, the mountain had flat. top. Since then, people named the mountain as Mount Wurung. Wurung is taken from Javanese and it means unfinished or cancelled. </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="142" name="Baturaden" tags="" position="0,324">THERE was a village in Central Java. The head of the village was called the Adipati. He was very rich. He had a big house. He also had many employees who worked for him,

The Adipati was very much respected. It was not just because he was the head of the village, but also he was from a noble family. Most of the villagers were just common people.

The Adipati had a beautiful daughter. She was very famous. Everybody knew her and loved her. The Adipati&#39;s daughter was not only beautiful, but also kind-hearted. She was polite and helpful.

The Adipati&#39;s daughter was still single. The Adipati asked his only daughter to get married soon.

&quot;What are you waiting for? You are old enough to get married. I know lots of young men love you and some of them have already asked my permission to marry you. I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t have any problem to choose the man you want to marry,&quot; said the Adipati.

His daughter was speechless. She was trying to say to her father that she was in love with a man. However she was so scared to tell him about the man she loved.

Well, who was the man she loved? His name was Suta. He was one of the Adipati&#39;s employees. Unlike the Adipati&#39;s family, Suta was not from a noble family. He was just common people.

Suta and the Adipati&#39;s daughter had a secret relationship. They loved each other. They did not tell anyone about it. However they knew thatsooner or later they had to tell the Adipati before he knew it from sorneone else.

So, when the Adipati asked his daughter to get married soon, she thought it was time for her to teII his father about her relationship with Suta.

&quot;You what!!!&quot; yelled the Adipati.

He was so angry when he heard that his only daughter was having a relationship with one of his employees.

&quot;You are from a noble fami.ly and Suta is just a common person! You don&#39;t deserve him!&quot; The Adipati was so angry.

The daughter was crying. This was exactly what she was afraid of. She was completely helpless.

After that, the Adipati asked Suta to leave his big house.

&quot;I don&#39;t want you to work here anymore. Get out!&quot; yelled the Adipati to Suta. Suta could not do anything. Before he left, he asked his friend to give his letter to the Adipati&#39;s daughter.

The Adipati&#39;s daughter was crying when she read Suta&#39;s letter. Suta told her that the Adipati had asked him to leave. Suta was planning to go to another place. He also asked the Adipati&#39;s daughter to join him.

The Adipati&#39;s daughter knew that she could not live without Suta. So, she left the house and joined Suta.

They both walked and walked. They flnally arrived in an empty place. Nobody lived there. Suta and the Adipati&#39;s daughter decided to stay and built their house.

One by one, people came and also stayed there. Slowly it became a village. Because they did not have a leader, they asked Suta to become their leader.

They also named their place as Baturaden, it was from the words batur and raden. Batur means employee/helper and raden is related to the level of noble family. Baturaden is located in Central Java. The place is getting bigger and more people live there.</tw-passagedata>

After the elephant was tamed, he wanted to bring it to Jepara. He would propose her. In the meantime, people were talking about Ki Ageng Kedungsari. They were amazed with his power to tame an elephant. They all thought that elephants were too difficult to handle. One of the people who heard about Ki Ageng Kedungsari&#39;s elephant was Ki Ageng Menawan. He had been.in love with her for a long time.

Unfortunately he did not have the power to catch an elephant. So, when he heard that Ki Ageng Kedungsari was able to catch an elephant, he r,vas very jealous!

Ki Ageng Menawan planned to steal the elephant. Howeve4, he knew he could not beat Ki Ageng Kedungsari alone. He had to ask someone to help him fight Ki Ageng Kedungsari. He had someone in his mind to help him. It was Ki Watu Gede.

The fight could not be avoided any more. KiAgeng Menawan and Ki Watu Gede helped each other. They werg fighting side by side to beat Ki Ageng Kedungsari.

Although it was one againts two, Ki Ageng Kedungsari was able to balance the fight. The three of them were very powerful. They were fighting for days and there was no any sign that someone would give up.

Finally, the three of them were trying to grab the elephant. Ki Ageng Menawan was holding the head and the front part. Ki Ageng Kedungsari was holding the body and Ki Watu Gede was holding the back part of the elephant. They were holding so tightly that the elephant was broken into three big pieces: the front part, the body, and the back part. They all brought their parts to their hometown.

The three parts later changed into big stones. Until now people can see the stones. The stones are in Kedungsari Village, Menawan Village, and Watu Gede Village. The names of the villages are after the names of the people who were fighting to win the elephant.</tw-passagedata>

They were worried. Usually, when rain was falling down heavily, the area was flooded. They hoped rain would stop soon. Rain finally stopped. Sadly, the area was flooded. People worked and helped each other. They also provided food and medicine. And after several days, the flood was gone. The area was dried.

The villagers were digging the lands horizontally. The line was kilometers away. It connected the big river with the sea. And after working hard for several months, the channel in the east finally finished. Everybody was happy. Afterwards, they were going to build the channel in the west.

They started digging the lands. At first it ran well. They were digging and they put the land on the sides of the channel surface. Strangely, something happened. After they finished digging the land and wanted to continue digging horizontally, the land on the surface always fell down and slid.

Everybody was confused. They tried to dig back but right after they finished digging, the land on the surface always fell down and slid.

&quot;What should we do? We don&#39;t make any progress,&quot; said one villager.

&quot;Yes, you are right. I&#39;m also tired of doing the same again and again,&quot; said another villager.

The villagers said thank you. They immediately went back to the digging site. They told other villagers about the stones. They put the stones on each side.

Amazingly, the land on the surface stopped falling down. They allwere happy. They continued digging and finished the channel. Finally the channel was completely finished. And when rain fell dorvry water was running through the channels. It worked! The area was not flooded anymore.

&quot;Excuse me, Sir. Will you help me? I&#39;m so hungry, would you please give me some food?&quot; asked Jaka Klinting to a villager. Jaka Klinting was wearing a shabby cloth. He did not look good at all. His hair was long and messy. Everyone who saw him would not feel comfortable.

&quot;What? Give you food? No way!&quot; said the man. Then, Jaka Klinting met another man. Sadly, he also refused to help him. Jaka Klinting continued walking. Every time he met a villager, he always asked for food. Sadly, the villagers did not help him.

Finally, he arrived at an old woman&#39;s house. Her name was Nyai Lantung.

&quot;Excuse me, Ma&#39;am. I&#39;m really hungry. I had not eaten for many days. Would you please give me some food?&quot; asked Jaka Klinting.

&quot;Of course, please come in. I&#39;ll prepare the food for you,&quot; said Nyai Lantung.

Nyai Lantung was a widow. Her husband had died years ago. She did not have a child. Nyai Lantung was a poor woman. She was kind and she always helped people.

Do you have a place to stay, young man?&quot;

&quot;No, Ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;You can stay here until you can find a better place.&quot;

Jaka Klinting was very grateful.

To return Nyai Lantung&#39;s kindness, he always helped her do anything. Nyai Lantung was also happy. Jaka Klinting did not only help her do the household chores, but he also helped her earn some money by farming.

Sadly, the villagers still did not like Jaka Kinting. They always teased him and made fun of him. They always said bad things to him.

&quot;Hey you, ugly man! What are you doing here? Your place is in the jungle with the monkeys, ha ha ha...&quot;

Every day, the villagers always made fun of Jaka Klinting. However, he never responded to them. He was always silent.

But one day, he could not take it anymore. It happened when the villagers also made fun of Nyai Lantung.

&quot;I know why you stay at Nyai Lantung&#39;s house. Because you and her are from the same family, the monkey, ha ha ha...&quot;

&quot;Shut up! You can insult me. But I don&#39;t want you to insult Nyai Lantung. She is a kind woman. She is better than you are!&quot; jaka Klinting was very angry. He wanted to give them a lesson.

&quot;I will put this stick on the ground. If anyone can pull it out, I will give him a lot of money,&quot; said Jaka Klinting.

The villagers were laughing. They all thought he was crazy. The stick was small and they thought they could pull it out easily.

Amazingly, they could not do it. All the men tried to pull the stick out of the ground, but they could not do it.

&quot;It&#39;s my turn now,&quot; said Jaka Klinting. With just a simple move, he could pull the stick.

People were surprised. The stick made a hole on the ground. Slowly, water was flowing from the hole. Slow but sure, the water flooded the village.

All the villagers tried to save their lives. All the houses were under water, except Nyai Lantung&#39;s house.

Who was Jaka Klinting? And why did he have supernatural power? Well, the villagers did not know that Jaka Klinting was a dragon. He changed himself into a human because in his hometown, people were trying to kill him as a dragon. And the water finally made a swamp. People then named the swamp as Rawa Pening.

<tw-passagedata pid="146" name="A Lesson for the Tiger" tags="" position="0,60">A Long time ago, all animals had a king. Their king was the tiger. All animals were afraid of him. The tiger was the strongest among them. He was also very mean. He would hit any animals when they disobeyed him. They wanted to give the tiger a lesson.

&quot;Listen friends, we need to find a way. The tiger is also cruel especially to weak animals like me,&quot; said the rabbit.

&quot;I have an idea,&quot; said the mouse deer. &quot;He is not clever as he looks. I think I can trick him,&quot; said the mouse deer.

&quot;How will you trick him?&quot; asked the rabbit.

&quot;It&#39;s easy. You meet the tiger and tell him that I challenge him to fight.&quot;

&quot;What? Are you kidding? You cannot win!&quot; said the rabbit.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m not really challenging him to fight. It&#39;s all part of the plan.&quot;

The mouse deer continued.

&quot;You just tell him that I challenge him to fight under that big tree,&quot; the mouse deer pointed to a big tree near them.

Later the rabbit met the tiger and he told the tiger about the challenge.

What!? Is it true?! OK, tell the mouse deer I accept his challenge. I will beat him so easily,&quot; said the tiger. He was so arrogant.

The tiger went to the big tree. He saw the mouse deer staring at the branches of the tree.

&quot;Hey mouse deer! I heard you challenge me to fight. Come, fight now!&quot; screamed the tiger.

However, the mouse deer did not move at all. He kept on staring on the branches of the tree.

&quot;Mouse deer! Are you deaf?&quot; the tiger was really angry.

&quot;Shh... Be quiet,&quot; said the mouse deer.

&quot;What? You asked me to be quiet.&quot; The tiger really don&#39;t understand.

&quot;Yes. Do you see that big round thing in that branch? last night I had a dream. An owl told me that the big round thing above us can give me power.&quot;

He continued. &quot;The problem is I cannot jump or climb to grab that thing.&quot;

&quot;Really? Are you sure?&quot; asked the tiger.

&quot;Well, I am the king and I deserve that power. So I want you to get out of here otherwise I will hit you,&quot; said the tiger.

The mouse deer pretended to be scared. He immediately ran away. Meanwhile, the tiger climbed the tree. He was trying to grab the round thing in the branch of the tree.

The tiger did not know that the round thing was actually the beehive! And when he was finally able to grab the beehive, he fell down to the ground.

All the bees were angry. They all attacked and stung the tiger. The bees were angry because the tiger had already destroyed their home.

The tiger was in a great pain. He could not fight the bees. he asked for help. Unfortunately, the animals did not want to help him.

The tiger finally went to the river. He swam and he survived. He realized the mistake. Since then he changed, he became a wise king.</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="148" name="The Queen Mosquito" tags="" position="797,53">THERE was a village in Yogyakarta. The villagers were farmers. They lived happily and peacefully. They had fertile land and healthy livestock.

It was harvest. All farmers were happy because soon they would sell their rice and got lots of money.

However, while they were busy working in the rice fields, one farmer came and told them a bad news.

&quot;The queen mosquito is coming! Save our livestock!&quot; said the farmer.

All farmers immediately left their rice fields and tried to save their chickens, ducks, goats, and cows.

Why were they afraid of the queen mosquito? Well, this mosquito was different from other mosquitoes. She was the queen mosquito. She was very big. She was as big as a goat! Also she could fly as fast as a bird. When the queen was thirsty she would attack any animals and sucked the blood. When there were no animals, the queen would attack humans! That was why farmers were so scared.

After all their livestock was safe, all farmers were having a meeting.

&quot;We have to do something! We have to find a way how to stop the queen mosquito.&quot;

An old man spoke. He was known as the Smartest and wisest person.

&quot;I know how to stop the queen. Her power is in her earrings. If we can get her earrings, she will be powerless and she will be as small as other mosquitoes.&quot;

&quot;But how can we steal her earrings?&quot; asked one man.

&quot;The queen will lay her eggs soon. She cannot do it alone. She needs help to lay her eggs. I&#39;m sure she will ask Madam Sri to help her.&quot;

Who was Madam Sri? Well, she was a nurse. She often helped women deliver their babies. Then the old man talked to Madam Sri. She agreed to help. The old man told her how to steal the earrings. The queen mosquito came. She talked to Madam Sri. Yes, she could talk to humans.

&quot;Please help me to lay my eggs.&quot;

&quot;I will help you but you have to give me your earrings. It&#39;s too dangerous if you still wear your earrings while you lay your eggs.&quot;

The queen mosquito believed her. Without any doubts, she gave her the earrings. Then Madam Sri asked her to sit on the bushes. Again, the queen mosquito listened to her.

The queen mosquito gave her the earrings. Madam Sri immediately kept them in a very safe place. When the queen was sitting comfortably on the bushes, Madam Sri burnt the bushes. The smoke made the queen very weak. Amazingly she slowly became very small, just like any other mosquitoes.

The queen was very angry. She yelled and screamed! She asked Madam Sri to return her earrings. However she was too small. She could not speak clearly and Madam Sri only heard buzzing sound.

The queen thought it was useless so she asked all the mosquitoes to attack Madam Sri. When she saw lots of mosquitoes came to attack her, Madam Sri again burnt the bushes.

The smoke made the mosquitoes very weak and some of them died. However the queen survived and she swore that she would always ask mosquitoes to attack humans.

Well, that is why we hear mosquitoes buzzing. They ask us to return their queen&#39;s earrings!</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="149" name="Gentong Mountain" tags="" position="792,185">Raden Patah was so happy. The palace was very much different from the jungle. And the king, his father, taught him everything.

The king hoped that Raden Patah could someday replace him as a king.

Slowly Raden Patah became a great man. When he was adult, he already mastered a lot of skills. People respected him. And it was not only because he was the son of a king, or he was skillful in many things, but it was because he was kind, polite, and helpful.

Lots of people loved him. The king ordered Raden Patah to go to Palembang. Raden Patah was asked to stay and lead the people there. The place was under the power of Majapahit Kingdom. It was a great task for Raden Patah. And he did the task responsibly.

Raden Patah stayed in Palembang for several years. Under his power, the place became prosperous. The people were happy. And Raden Patah also recruited many men to be his soldiers. He built strong army.

Raden Patah missed his father so much. One night he had a dream about his father. He thought there was something wrong with him. Therefore he left Palembang in a hurry. He also brought some soldiers to go with him. When he arrived in Java, a soldier of Majapahit Kingdom saw Raden Patah and his soldiers coming to Majapahit Kingdom.

The soldier immediately reported to the king. The king was surprised to hear the report. He did not know why Raden Patah came with lots of soldiers. One of his advisors told him that Raden Patah might revenge, because the king had left and abandoned him in the jungle.

The king believed what the advisor said. He asked everybody to leave the palace. When Raden Patah arrived in the palace he was so disappointed to see that the palace was empty. He did not see anyone there. He heard that the king had left. So Raden Patah ordered his soldiers to follow the king.

The king heard that Raden Patah followed him. So, he moved to another place. He went to a big hill and stayed there with the queen and some soldiers.

The hill was empty and infertile. There was no any tree. And it was very hot. There was no source of water. They were so thirsty.

Raden Patah finally arrived in the hill. He knew they were so thirsty. He wanted to help them. With his power, he brought a big gentong, it&#39;s a large earthenware bowl for water. He lifted the gentong and threw it to the top of the hill.

The gentong landed well on the top of the hill. The king and the rest of the people were grateful. They immediately drank the water. And when Raden Patah arrived, he asked his father why he left the palace.

The father explained and Raden Patah understood that there was misunderstanding. He told his father that he never planned to attack Majapahit. Raden Patah and his father went back to the palace. And the gentong was still on the top of the big hill. Since then people named the hill as Gunung Gentong or Gentong Mountain.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="150" name="Raden Patah" tags="" position="667,185">PRABU Brawijaya was the King of Majapahit Kingdom. He had a wife and some concubines. One of the concubines was Ratu Mayangsari. She was the most beautiful concubine. In fact she was more beautiful than the Queen. The King really loved Ratu Mayangsari. He always took care of her very well and that made the Queen jealous. She always told the King bad things about the concubine. The King understood that his wife hated Ratu Mayangsari.

&quot;I have to do something! I don&#39;t want her to be here anymore!&quot; said the Queen angrily.

Why was she so upset? Well, Ratu Mayangsari was pregnant and that made the Queen hated her more and more.

The King also knew that Ratu Mayangsari was pregnant. He planned to move her to another place.

He thought that the palace was not safe enough for her. The King brought Ratu Mayangsari to a village. He went to an old man&#39;s house. He knew the man very well. His name was Ki Juru Sawah.

&quot;Ki, I need your help. Please take care of her. And when she delivers a baby, please take care of the baby. After all, the baby is my child,&quot; said the King.

&quot;I will, Your Majesty,&quot; said Ki Juru Sawah.

Since then Ratu Mayangsari lived in the village. When the baby was born, she named him Raden Patah.

Raden Patah grew as a kind and polite kid. Ki juru Sawah loved him like his own son. He also taught him everything, especially martial arts. Raden Patah was the son of the King. Therefore, he inherited the supernatural power that his father had.

One day, Ki Juru Sawah wanted to go to the palace.

&quot;May I join you, please?&quot; asked Raden Patah.

Ki Juru Sawah did not have the heart so he let Raden Patah join him.

The journey was so fun. Raden Patah had never left his village before. He was amazed by the view and kept on asking things to Ki Juru Sawah. He answered the questions happily. He was glad to see Raden Patah enjoyed the journey.

When they arrived at the palace, Ki Juru Sawah entered the palace and Raden Patah stayed outside of the palace. At first, Raden Patah could stay well, but slowly he was so curious about the palace. He secretly entered the palace. With his power, he could enter the palace and passed the guards.

Raden Patah entered a secret room. It was a room for sacred things. Raden Patah was amazed. He saw a big gong. He hit the gong and that made thunderous sound.

The sound was so loud! Everybody in the palace could hear it. They all were surprised. Not everybody could hit the gong! Only special people, like the King, could hit the gong.

&quot;Guards! Go to the secret room! Find and bring me the person who hit the gong!&quot; ordered the King.

The guard rushed to the room. They saw a little kid near the gong and brought him to the King.

&quot;Who are you? And where is your father?&quot; asked the King.

&quot;My name is Raden Patah and I don&#39;t have a father. I&#39;m here with my grandfather, his name is Ki
Juru Sawah,&quot; said Raden Patah.

&quot;Really? Ki Juru Sawah, is he your grandson?&quot; asked the King.

&quot;Your Majesty, actually he is your son. His mother is Ratu Mayangsari.&quot;

&quot;Really? My son... please forgive me,&quot; said the King.

He hugged Raden Patah. He felt so guilty and apologized to his son. He wanted to make up for his mistake. Therefore, he asked Raden Patah and his mother to stay in the palace. Since then Raden Patah and his mother lived in the palace. When he grew up, Raden Patah became a great man and very famous.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="151" name="The Legend of Limestone Hill" tags="" position="547,60">Once upon a time in Gunung Kidul, Yogyakarta, there was a kingdom named Medang Kingdom. The king was King Dewata Cengkar. He liked to eat. The chef in the palace always worked hard. The king was never satisfied with the food.

One day, the chef accidentally cut his finger and the blood dropped into the food. The chef was really scared and he told his friends not to tell the king about it. His friends agreed.

After the food was served, the king immediately ate. He really enjoyed the food. He said it was the most delicious food he ever had. Then he had a party and invited many people. He wanted his guests to eat his delicious food. However, the food was not as delicious as the king had earlier. The king was angry, he sent the chef to the jail.

Later, the chef’s friends told the king about the chef’s blood in the food. Probably the blood made the food delicious. The king then asked his soldiers to bring him a villager and dropped his blood to the food. It was true! The food was very delicious. Since then the king always asked his soldiers to go around the villages and bring him someone’s blood.

People were scared. They did not want their blood to be taken. They prayed to Gods days and nights. Gods listened to their prayer. They sent Aji Saka. He was a man with great supernatural power.

When he was meditating, he heard a whisper. He was asked to go to Medang Kingdom to help the people. When he arrived at the kingdom, he told the soldiers that he wanted to give his blood. The soldiers later told the king that there was a man who willing to gave his blood.

The king was very happy. He had not eaten delicious food for a long time. That was because his soldiers could not find a villager who was willing to give his blood.

“I will give you my blood, but with one condition. You have to take off my robe,” said Aji Saka.

“Ha ha ha! That is easy,” said the king.

However when he tried to take off the robe, the king never succeeded. The robe seemed to be very long. The king was very tired. When the king stopped to rest, Aji Saka pushed him. The king fell down. And amazingly the king slowly changed into a white crocodile.

Aji Saka prepared his arrow. He pointed the arrow to the white crocodile. Right after the arrow hit the crocodile’s body, it died instantly.

And on the spot where the crocodile lied down, grew a limestone hill. The hill was infertile. It was very difficult for the villagers to plant a tree there. The villagers then made good use of the hill to decorate their houses.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="152" name="Kiskenda Cave" tags="" position="422,60">KISKENDA Cave was a home for Maesasura and Lembusura. They were brothers and they were strange creatures. They had human bodies but they had animal heads. They were the kings of all the wild animals in the jungle. They were also immortal. When one of them was dead, the other just had to step over the dead body then the dead one would come back to life!

Maesasura fell in love with Dewi Tara, she was a goddess and the daughter of Bathara Indra. The two brothers went to the heaven and talked to Bathara Indra. The god refused their proposal. He had heard how bad they were. It made them become very angry! The two strange creatures attacked all the gods and the goddesses in the heaven. All the gods and the goddesses were helpless. They gave up!

Maesasura and Lembusura kidnapped Dewi Tara and brought her to their home in Kiskenda Cave.

Bathara Guru, the god of gods, found a way how to bring Dewi Tara back to the heaven. There was a magic weapon named Aji Pancasona. The problem was that no one could handle the weapon. Only a man who had pure heart could possess it. All the gods and the goddesses looked for the man and they flnally agreed to give it to Subali. He was the son of a holy man named Resi Gotama.

Subali was meditating when the gods came to him. They told him about how Maesasura and Lembusura kidnapped Dewi Tara. Hq agreed to help. He asked his younger brother, Sugriwa, to go with him.

Sulali and Sugriwa arrived at the Kiskenda Cave. Subali asked his brother to wait outside the cave. He said, &quot;If you see red blood flowing, it means they are dead. But if you see white blood, it means I&#39;m dead. After that you have to close the cave with a big stone.&quot;

Sugriwa understood. Later Subali went inside the cave. He saw Dewi Tara and then he immediately brought her outside the cave. The two strange creatures were angry! They attacked him. With his magic weapon, Subali fought back. Maesasura was hit terribly. He was dead! Lembusura immediately stepped over his brother&#39;s dead body. Amazingly Maesasura was back to life! Subali was thinking. He knew it was useless if he killed one of them. He had to kill both of them at the same time!

And it worked! Maesasura and Lembusura were dead! Their blood mixed with their brain and it changed the color into white.

Sugriwa saw the &#39;white blood&#39;. He thought his brother was dead. So he immediately closed the cave.

Su.bali was angry when the cave was closed. He thought his brother betrayed him. In the mean time, all the gods and the goddesses were happy when Dewi Tara was back home.

Bathara Indra was so grateful and he planned to set the wedding of Sugriwa and Dewi Tara. However during the wedding Subali came! He was so angry! He accused his brother for betraying him. He fought Sugriwa!

Their father stopped their fight. He asked what happened. Sugriwa told him about the &quot;white blood&quot; flowing and he thought Subali was dead.

The father was angry at Subali. He said &quot;Why do you think you have white blood? What makes you think you are special and different from us? All humans have red blood!&quot;

The father asked Subali to continue meditating. He hoped Subali to be wiser. Subali did what his father said. He went back meditating.

Later the gods asked Sugriwa and Dewi Tara to live in Kiskenda Cave and build a kingdom. The cave still exists until now. It is located in Kulon Progo, Yogfakarta.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="153" name="Retna Lestari and Bakuh the Giant" tags="" position="297,60">A long time ago, there was a mean giant. And every time he wanted to eat, he always looked for the animals. He ate almost all kinds of animals. And of course, the animals did not live peacefully. They were scared Bakuh would eat them.

Slowly, the numbers of animals were decreasing. And finally there was no animal left in the jungle. Bakuh started to go to the villages. He wanted to eat humans!

The gods and the goddess in the heaven were angry. They wanted to punish Bakuh. Thereforg they sent one beautiful goddess. Her name was Retna Lestari.

Bakuh was walkingwhen he saw Retna Lestari picking some flowers. He was surprised to see a beautiful woman in the jungle. He fell in love instantly. &quot;Hello, beautiful girl. What&#39;s your name? I never saw you before,&quot; said Bakuh.

&quot;My name is Retna Lestari. And of course you never saw me. I always ran and saved my life when you were hungry. I hope now you are not hungry,&quot; said Retna Lestari.

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid, Retna. I will never eat you. You are so beautiful and I&#39;m in love with you. Will you marry  me?&quot; asked Bakuh.

&quot;What? No way! I will never marry a mean giant like you.&quot;

&quot;l&#39;ll do anything for you, Retna.&quot;

&quot;Anything? OK.II wants to have red clouds during sunset. But I don&#39;t want you to get it for me. I don&#39;t want your sharp nails to tear the clouds.&quot;

&quot;So, what do I have to do?&quot;

&quot;Simple. You just lie down with your face downward. I will stand on your back I hope I can reach the clouds.&quot;

And then Bakuh lied down with his face downward. And when Retna Lestari was already standing on his back, she said, &quot;I cannot reach the clouds. I will put some big stone on your back. I want to stand on the stones so I can reach the clouds.&quot;

&quot;Can you reach the clouds now?&quot; asked Bakuh.

&quot;Not yet, I will put more stones on your body. And remember, don&#39;t move your body. If you do, I will , fall.&quot; said Retna Lestari.

She immediately put more stones. This tipe she put bigger stones. With her power as a goddess, she could put the big stones easily.

Slowly, all Bakuh&#39;s body was covered by stones. Retna Lestari put two very big stones, one on his head and one on his feet. Bakuh could not breathe. He wanted to stand up but he could not do it. He then realized that Retna Lestari already tricked him. He just yelled and screamed!

Slowly the two big stones became mountains. The big stone on Bakuh&#39;s head became Merapi Mountain and the big stone on his feet became Merbabu Mountain.

People now say that when they hear a rumbling noise from the mountains, they believe that Baku is yelling and screaming. He is cursing Retna Lestari for tricking him.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="154" name="The Curse of Joko Bandung" tags="" position="172,60">A long time ago, there were two kingdoms. They were Pengging Kingdom and Prambanan Kingdom. The king were fighting. They were at war! Pengging&#39;s king was Joko Bandung. He was very strong and powerful. He had great martial art skill. He led the soldiers and fought bravely.
Meanwhile, Prabu Boko, the king of Prambanan sent a giant to fight against Joko Bandung. The Giants name was Bandawasa.

Bandawasa was very big. Joko Bandung was not afraid with the giant. They were fighting. And finally Joko Bandung won the fight. Before he died, Bandawasa&#39;s spirit joined Joko Bandung&#39;s spirit. That made Joko Bandung became more powerful. He then added Bandawasa&#39;s name into his name. His name changed into Joko Bandung Bandawasa.

Joko Bandung and his soldiers were attacking the palace of Prambanan Kingdom. Joko Bandung was looking for Prabu Boko. He wanted to kill the king of Prambanan Kingdom. Joko Bandung was more powerful. He killed Prabu Boko.

Joko Bandung occupied the palace. He asked all Prabu Boko&#39;s family to gather. He met Prabu Boko&#39;s beautiful daughter. Her name was Roro Jonggrang. he fell in love with her. He wanted to marry her.

Roro Jonggrang did not want to marry him. She hated Joko Bandung. However she was afraid and did not have any courage to refuse the marriage proposal. She had an idea how to refuse the proposal.

She would ask Joko Bandung to build 1.000 temples only in one night. If he could build the temples, Roro Jonggrang would marry him. Joko Bandung agreed. He accepted the challenge. He was not worried, he would asked the genies and the spirits to help him.

Joko Bandung and his genies started to work. They build the temples one by one. Roro Jonggrang was really worried. She knew Joko Bandung could not finish building 1.000 temples before sun rose.

She was thinking very hard. She had to find a way how to stop the genies and the spirit fro building the temples. Suddenly she had an idea.

She asked all the girls to make a lot of noise by grinding the rice in the mortar. She also asked them to make fire. She hopped that the spirits and the genies would think that sun was going to rise.

It worked! The noise and the fire woke the cocks up. The cocks were crowing. The spirits and the genies thought that morning would come soon.

And they also thought the sun would rise soon. The spirits and the genies were afraid of the sunlight. They left Joko Bandung alone. Joko Bandung was very angry! He knew Roro Jonggrang was plying a trick on him.

&quot;Why did you do that? If you do not want to marry me, why don&#39;t you just say it? You are just looking for an excuse to refuse me!&quot; said Joko Bandung.

He continued, &quot;You are so stubborn like a stone. I curse you to become a statue!&quot;

Joko Bandung&#39;s magic power had changed Roro Jonggrang into a statue! Since then people named the temples that the spirit and the genies build as Sewu Temple. And the people also named the Prambanan Temple as Roro Jonggrang Temple.</tw-passagedata>

“Yes, father. I’m going home now. The cows are also full.”

The boy, Joko Panjer, was a shepherd. Every day his father always asked him to take the cows to the field to eat some grass. Joko Panjer was a nice and diligent boy. He always obeyed and helped his poor parents. One day, while Joko was busy looking after the cows, a little girl came to him.

“Hello, young girl. What’s your name? And what are you doing here? Where do you live?” Joko gave her some questions.

He was surprised to see a little girl on the field. He felt that the girl was not from his neighborhood. She dressed beautifully.

“My name is Lara Inten. May I be your friend? I don’t have a friend to play,” said the little girl.

“I’m Joko Panjer. Lara Inten, where do you live? Where are you from?”

“If I tell you, you don’t want to play with me. So, may I be your friend?”

Actually, Joko was also lonely in the field. Every day he did not have a friend to talk and play together. All of his friends were in the village. Since then, Lara Inten and Joko were friends. They always had a good time on the field. Sometimes, they played hide and seek and other times they just sang some songs. They were happy! In one afternoon, while Joko and Lara were playing, suddenly some men came to them. Those men were soldiers from the kingdom.

“Princess Lara, here you are. Now we know why you always disappear in the palace. Please come back with us, the king and the queen are waiting for you.”

“You are a princess? Why didn’t you tell me?” asked Joko to Lara.

“Joko, I already told you. If you know who I am, you don’t want to play with me. I want you to be my friend, because I am lonely.”

Lara Inten then returned back to the palace. She talked to her parents about Joko. The king and the queen then decided to ask Joko and his family to stay in the palace.

Now everyday, Joko and Lara could play together. Joko’s parents were very happy. Now the family were not poor anymore.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="157" name="The Legend of Banyuwangi" tags="" position="917,178">ONCE upon a time in Sindureja Kingdom, King Sidareja was talking to his vice regent, his name was Patih Sidapaksa. The King asked Patih Sidapaksa to give him the flesh of a young deer.

Patih Sidapaksa took the mission.
When he arrived in the jungle, he saw a young deer. He pointed his arrow to the deer. Unfortunately, he missed the target. He ran after the deer. He was running and running until he arrived at a hut. Patih Sidapaksa knocked the door.

A young and beautiful girl opened the door. She was very beautiful. Patih Sidapaksa fell in love at the first sight.“How can I help you Sir?” asked the girl.

&quot;I...I...am looking for a young deer&quot;, Patih Sidapaksa was speechless.

&quot;You can find a lot of deer in the jungle. But it&#39;s already late and it will be dark soon. You can continue hunting tomorrow morning. You can come and spend the night here. Both my father and I are happy to welcome you&quot;, said the girl.

Patih Sidapaksa accepted the offer.
He introduced himself. The girl&#39;s name was Sri Tanjung and her father&#39;s name was Ki Buyut.
In the morning, Patih Sidapaksa continued his hunting and after he got a young deer he returned to the hut.

He came back because he wanted to marry Sri Tanjung. Luckily, Sri Tanjung also loved him.

Later Patih Sidapaksa asked them to join him to the palace. The King was very happy Patih Sidapaksa brought him a young deer. However he was also amazed by the beauty of Sri Tanjung.


The King also fell in love with her. The King had a bad plan. He wanted to marry Sri Tanjung. So he gave Patih Sidapaksa a very difficult mission. The King asked Patih Sidapaksa to give him three golden rings from Indran Kingdom. Patih Sidapaksa knew the mission was more difficult than hunting a young deer. Indran Kingdom was not an ordinary kingdom. It was a kingdom of criminals! No one ever came back after going there. However he still accepted the mission. And before he left, he asked Sri Tanjung to wait for him.

After Patih Sidapaksa left, the King approached Sri Tanjung. He proposed Sri Tanjung to marry him. He promised Sri Tanjung to be a queen. She did not accept the proposal. She loved Patih Sidapaksa and she already promised to wait for him. The King was angry and put her in the jail.

Luckily, Patih Sidapaksa could do the mission and came back to the palace. Sadly he could not meet Sri Tanjung. The King lied. He said Sri Tanjung was in jail because she asked the King to marry her. The King said Sri Tanjung wanted to be a queen. At first Patih Sidapaksa believed the King. But Sri Tanjung then said.

&quot;Throw me to the river. If the river smells good, it means I&#39;m innocent. However if the river smells bad, then the King is lying&quot;, said Sri Tanjung.

Patih Sidapaksa then threw her into the river. Amazingly, the river smelled good. Patih Sidapaksa was very sorry. Sri Tanjung died. He regretted not to believe her.

When the river smelled good, people instantly said Banyuwangi. Banyu means water and Wangi means good smell. Since then the place has been named Banyuwangi. </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="158" name="The Legend of Mount Arjuna" tags="" position="792,187">THE Pandawas were five brothers who had supernatural power. They were Yudistira, Bima, Arjuna, and the twins Nakula and Sadewa.

Compaied to his brothers, Arjuna had the most supernatural power. He got his power by meditating. He could ask the gods to give him supernatural power.

Arjuna wanted to have more power. He planned to meditate on the top of a mountain. He climbed one big mountain and started meditating on the top of the mountain.

Arjuna concentrated very hard. He was lot disturbed by anything around him. Amazingly while he was meditating, the mountain was slowly getting bigger and higher.

The mountain was so high that it finally touched the heaven. It was the home of the gods. The hit made the heaven shaking. The gods and the goddesses were restless. They talked to Batara Guru, the god of all gods.

&quot;We have to stop Arjuna. If he continues to meditate, the mountain is going to be bigger and higher. It will destroy the heaven!&quot; said one god.

Batara guru understood. He asked Batara Narada to meet Arjuna.

&quot;Tell him to stop meditating. It&#39;s dangerous for the heaven,&quot; asked Batara Guru.

Batara Narada left the heaven and flew to the mountain. In just a moment, he already saw Arjuna.

He said, &quot;Please stop meditating. The mountain will destroy the heaven.&quot;

However Arjuna did not respond. He already made up ]ris mind, he would not stop meditating until the gods gave him more supernatural power.

Batara Narada Save up. He could not make Arjuna stop meditating. He flew back to the heaven.

Batara Guru then asked beautiirl angels. they flew to the mountain and tried to stop Ariuna. one angel was laughing, one was tickling him, and other angels were trying to make lots of noise. A,gain, the angels failed to stop him.

Later, Batara Guru sent some genies. They flewto the mountain. They were trying to scare Arjuna. Still, they failed!

Finally, Batara Guru asked Batara Semar to stqp Arjuna from meditating. Though Semar was a god, but he lived on earth. His job was to take care of the Pandawas.

Batara Semar then asked Batara Togog to help him. Later they meditated. Their bodies became very big. They cut the mountain where Arjuna was meditating into two big parts. They then threw one part to another area.

The sound of the mountain hitting the ground was very heavy. Ariuna woke up from his meditating. The heavy sound disturbed his concentration.

When Arjuna opened his eyes, Batara Semar and Batara Togog immediately came to Arjuna.

&quot;Please stop your meditation,&quot; said Batara Togog.

&quot;But I want to have more power,&quot; said Arjuna.

&quot;You already have lots of power. What else do you want? If you continue your meditation, the mountain will destroy the heaven!&quot; said Batara Semar.

Arjuna then realized how dangerous it was. He also realized that he should be grateful with the power he had and not to ask for more power. Later, Arjuna left the mountain and went home.

Since then, people named the mountain as Mount Arjuna while the other part of the mountain that Batara Semar and Batara Togog threw was named Mount Wukir.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="159" name="Joko Baru" tags="" position="417,185">THERE was a village in East Java. The place&#39; WAS SO beautiful and fertile. People lived happily and peacefully. Trees grew well and their rice fields always gave them lots of rice. They were happy to have lots of food.

More and more people came and stayed in the village. Slowly, the village was so full of people. The head of the village was Adipati Betak. He was so worried that soon the village could not hold enough people. He thought that the village would be so crowded and people could not live comfortably. He was thinking how to flnd a solution. Then he had an idea. In the village there was a big swamp.

&quot;If I could dry the swamp, lots of people can have a new place to live. They can build their houses!&quot; said Adipati Betak to himself. He was extremely happy! He just found a great solution for his crowded place.

Adipati Betak spoke to the all the villagers.

&#39;You all know that our village is getting crowded. I have a solution. Let&#39;s dry this swamp and later you can build your houses here,&quot; said Adipati Betak to the villagers.

They all were gathered near the swamp and brought all the tools and equipment to dry the swamp.

All the villagers were so happy to hear their leader&#39;s plan.

&quot;It was a great idea,&quot; they thought. Later, the villagers worked hard to dry the swamp.

The villagers had been working for days, but it seemed the swamp did not dry at all. Every time the swamp was almost dried, slowly water filled it.

What was the problem? There was a well in the bottom of the swamp. The villagers had tried to close it but still, water was flowing slowly. They had even used a very big and solid stone to close the well. Sadly, water was still flowing in the gap.

Adipati Betak made an announcement. &quot;I will promote anyone who can close the well as my deputy!&quot;

Yes, the head of the village had just held a competition and the reward was amazing, to be his deputy. It was a very great job! The reward made more people come and try their luck. Months passed by and still no one could close the well.

Meanwhile, there was a young man named Joko Baru. He lived very far away and he heard about the well and the problem of closing it.

Joko Baru talked to his father. His name was Ki Ageng Mangir. He was a wise man.

&quot;Father, I want to help Adipati Betak and his people to close the well but I don&#39;t know how to do it. Would you please tell me how to close the well?&quot; asked Joko Baru politely.

His father smiled. He asked &quot;Do you really want to help or you just want to be his deputy?&quot;

He already heard about the competition and its reward.

&quot;I just want to help, Father. I feel sorry for the people because I heard their village is so crowded. If they can dry the swamp, they can build their houses there,&quot; said |oko Baru.

The father knew his son was honest. Then he told him how to close the well.

&quot;Use the leaves ofsugar palm tree to close the well,&quot; said Ki Ageng Magir.

]oko Baru was so grateful. He said thank you to his father then left to help close the well.

When he arrived, Adipati Betakwas not sure that ]oko Baru could close the well. However he still gave him the chance.

Slowly, ]oko Baru closed the well with the leaves of sugar palm tree. Everybody was watching carefully. It worked! Water did not flow at all. The swamp was dried! Everybody cheered Joko Baru. They all were delighted to have a new place to live.

Though Joko Baru was not interested to be the deputy Adipati Betak still forced him. He wanted to keep his promise. Besides that, all the villagers also asked Joko Baru to accept the reward, it was to be the deputy. |oko Baru finally accepted to be the deputy. When Adipati Betak was old, he asked Joko Baru to replace him. |oko Baru became the new leader. He led wisely. </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="160" name="Kesuma" tags="" position="823,53">The story told us about a husband and a wife named Joko Seger and Roro Anteng. They had been married for years and they did not have any children yet.

They wanted to have children, they prayed to gods every day. And finally ]oko Seger had a vision. His wife would be pregnant if he meditated in a cave. However, a lion lived in the cave. Joko Seger fought with the lion. He won! Later he meditated in the cave. Now, do you want to know if ]oko Seger and Roro really had some children? Read on! Joko Seger was meditating.Later, he heard a voice.

&quot;Joko Segeq, all the Cods agreed to give you children, lots of children.&quot;

&quot;But there is one condition you have to do.&quot;

&quot;Say it. I will do anything as long as you give me lots of children,&quot; said Joko Seger.

&quot;You will have 25 children. But you have to sacrifice one of them when they are adult.&quot;

&quot;l agree,&quot; said Joko Seger without any doubts. He was so happy that Gods would give them 25 children. He thought sacrificing one of them would &#39;not be a problem. He would still have 24 children.

At home, ]oko Seger told his wife about his conversation with the god. And Roro Anteng could not say anything. After all, her husband had promised to Gods. She.just hoped that they would never have to sacrifice one child.

Later, Roro Anteng was pregnant. They had a baby! Joko Seger and Roro Anteng were very happy. The first baby was followed by other babies. Sometimes, the babies were born twins and other times the babies were born triplets. And the couple.finally had 25 children! They were extremely happy.

And when the children were grown up, |oko Seger had a dream. He talked to the God.

&quot;Joko Sege1, remember your promise. I want you to bring one of your children to the crater of Bromo Mountain. Sacrifice your child there. If you don&#39;t keep your promise, the mountain will erupt and destroy everything.&quot;

Joko Seger woke up from his sleep. He was restless. He then talked to all his children about his promise.

&quot;No, Fathel, I don&#39;t want to die,&quot; said the oldest.

&quot;I don&#39;t either, Father,&quot; said another child.

All the children refused to be sacrificed. ]oko Seger did not have the heart to force them. He loved all his children. Suddenly, the youngest child talked.
His name was Kesuma.

&quot;Please let me do it, Father. I love our family and the people of Tengger. But please, commemorate my sacrifice. Every year, please hold a ceremony and provide some offerings to the crater of Bromo Mountain,&quot; said Kesuma.

Kesuma was a very good son. He was obedient to his parents and very kind to other people. All the villagers loved him. He was kind and always helped other people.

Kesuma went to the crater. He jumped and he was swallowed by fire. Everybody was sad. And they all were very thankful to Kesuma. Because of him, their place was safe from the eruption of Bromo Mountain.

Until now, once a year the people of Tenggel always hold a ceremony to commemorate Kesuma. They bring offerings to the crater of Bromo Mountain.</tw-passagedata>

Although they came from different kind of family, Joko Seger&#39;s parentJwere priests and Roro Anteng&#39;s father was a king, they still loved each other. )oko Seger&#39;s father tried to warn hib son about his relationship with Roro Anteng.

&quot;You must understand, my son. Our families are different. Her father is a king, and&quot;I am a pries!&quot; explained his father.

&quot;But I really love het, father&#39; We have talked about our differences, and both of us do not see that as our problem,&quot; said |oko Seger. He then continued, &quot;We want to get married, father. Please give us your blessing.&quot;

His father r,t as speechless. He knew his son had already made up his mind to marry Roro Anteng. He then said, &quot;I give you my blessing, my son. Let&#39;s hope that your proposal will be accepted by the king.&quot;

]oko Seger went to the palace. He told the king that he wanted to marry Roro Anteng. The king had known their relationship for a long time. And he also knew that joko Seger was a good man. The king gave them his blessing to get married.

After the1, got married, Joko Seger and Roro Anteng moved. They did not want to live in their parents&#39;house. They decided to build a house near Bromo Mountain. Many people followed them. They built their houses, and soon there was a community there.

They called their place as Tengge4, taken from last names of Anteng and Seger. It was so many years after Joko Seger and Roro Anteng got married and they still did not have any children yet. Every day, they prayed, And in one night JokoSeger had a STsion. His wife would be pregnant if he meditated inside Widodaren Cave.

Joko Seger told his wife about his vision.

&quot;Please be careful. I heard a lion lives in that cave.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I will be very careful.&quot;

Joko Seger went to Widodaren Cave. And when he arrived, he stopped for a moment.

He rvaited. And later the lion walked out of the cave.

The lion roared loudly. Anyone who heard the roar would be very scared. But not Joko Sege1, he was not scared. Suddenly, the lion talked! He talked like humans!

&quot;Who are you?&quot;

&quot;My name is Joko Seger and I want to rneditate inside the cave.&quot;

&quot;Ha ha ha... You have to beat me if you want to walk inside the cave.&quot;

They were fighting. The lion was not an ordinary animal and joko Seger had a bit problem in fighting the lion. Fortunately, Joko Seger won the fight. The lion gave up. Joko Seger did not have the heart to kill the lion. The lion was very grateful. To show his gratitude, the lion changed himself as a stone. We still can see the stone with the shape of a lion near Bromo Mountain. People named it as Watu Singa, it means the lion stone. It is now a favorite tourist&#39;s destination.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="162" name="Dewi Kilisuci and Lembu Suro" tags="" position="0,60">A long time ago, there was a kingdom in Kediri, East Java. The king had a very beautiful daughter. Her name was Dewi Kilisuci. The princess was very beautiful. She was very famous. Many young men fell in love with her. They proposed the princess to be their wife. However the princess always rejected the proposal.

One of the men who came and proposed the princess was King Lembu Suro. He was not an ordinary king. He had great supernatural power. And he looked very strhnge. He did not have a human head. Instead, his head exactly looked like a cow. That was why his name was Lembu, which means a cow.

Dewi Kilisuci was very confused. She knew that King Lembu-Suro was very powerful. He had many soldiers. Some of them were genies. She also knew that the king was very mean. He would hit and destroy anything if his wishes did not come true. The princess was thinking how she could refuse the proposal. And then, she got an idea.

&quot;I will accept your proposal. However, I have one request,&quot; said the princess.

&quot;Ha..ha..ha.. I&#39;m glad you will accept my proposal. Just tell me, My Dear. What can I do for you? With my power, I can do anything,&quot; said King Lembu Suro.

&quot;Listen. I want to take a bath on the top of a mountain. And I want to do it on the top of Kelud Mountain. However, there is no a well there. I want you to dig and make a deep well,&quot; asked the princess.

&quot;That&#39;s all? Ha..ha..ha.. that&#39;s so easy for me,&quot; said King Lembu Suro.

Princess Dewi Kilisuci was silent. She did not think that the king would accepted the chalange.

She was thinking and finally she got another idea.

&quot;No, that&#39;s not all. I want you to finish the well within one night. The well has to be finished before sunrise&quot; said the princess.

&quot;Ha..ha..ha.. that&#39;s still not a problem for me. Just wait, you will see the well to be ready early in the morning.&quot;

The princess was so scared. She hoped the king could not finish the well before sunrise. Sadly, her fear came true. The king could finish the well before sunrise. He asked all his genies sgldiers to make the well.

&quot;I have finished the well. Now will you marry me?&quot; asked the king.

The princess was thinking another idea. And she got a good one. She asked all the kingdom soldiers to accompany her.

&quot;I&#39;m not going to believe it if I don&#39;t see it with my own eyes.&quot;

&quot;No problem, I will take you there.&quot;

&quot;OK but you have to go alone. Don&#39;t bring your soldiers. Meanwhile, I will bring my soldiers,&quot;
said the princess.

Later, King Lembu Suro, Princess Dewi Kili Suci, and her soldiers went to the top of Kelud Mountaid. When they reached the top, the princess pretended to be amazed with the well.

While she was standing at the side of the well, she dropped her ring.

King Lembu Suro did not want to see the princess sad. He jumped to the well to take the ring. And when the king was inside the well, the princess immediately asked her soldiers to close the well with big stones.

The stones were very big. King Lembu Suro was helpless. He was trapped inside the well. However before the well was completely closed, he was cursing.

&quot;Some day, I will destroy this area! I will make this mountain erupt!&quot;

Everyone who heard the curse was scared. To avoid the curse from happening they regularly gave offering. The habit continues until now. People always give offering with hope that their place will be safe from the eruption.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="163" name="A Dragon and a Baby" tags="" position="292,185">ONCE upon a time, there was a small village in East Kalimantan. The head of the village lived alone with his wife. They did not have any children yet.

Rain was falling for days. There was a big storm. The sound of thunder scared all the villagers. They did not have any courage to go outside of the house and that&#39;s including the
head of villagee

The head of the village and his wife were running out of fire woods to cook. He went outside to find some woods. His wife asked him to be careful. And after he got some woods, he went home.

On the way home, he saw a small worm lying on the ground. It looked helpless. The head of the village felt sorry. He carefully picked the worm and brought it home. Amazingly,rain stopped. There was no thunder anymore. Sun was shining brightly. The sky was clear!

At home, his wife was surprised to see the worm. Soon, she also felt sorry to the worm. She picked some leaves and fed the worm. It ate all the leaves. The head of the village and his wife were happy to see the worm was not weak anymore.

The wife took care of the worm with love. Slowly, the worm was getting bigger. It was slowly changing into a dragon! The head of the village and his wife still loved the dragon. They treated the dragon just like treating their own child.

One night, the head of the village had a dream. A beautiful girl came to him.

She said, &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid, Father. I&#39;m your child, I&#39;m the dragon. I want to thank you and Mother for taking care of me and loving me since I was small. Howevel, it was time for me to leave you. I want to go back to my home in the river. Please, bring me to the rivel, and you will get a good surprise there.&quot;

When he woke up, the head of the village told his wife about his dream. She asked him to do what the gifl in his dream asked him.

Latet the head of the village and his wife brought the dragon to the river. And when they arrived, the dragon swam in the river.

Suddenly, the dragon was able to talk. The voice of the dragon was exactly the same as the voice of the girl in his dream.

&quot;Thank you very much, Father and Mother. You are very kind. I will never forget you. I know you both really want to have a child. just wait for a moment and your wish will come true.&quot;

The head of the village and his wife were standing at the river side. They were waiting what would happen next. They saw the dragon was swimming and was getting far from them, until they could not see the dragon. After a while, the dragon came back.

There was a small basket in frbnt of the dragon&#39;s nose. It was swimming and pushing the basket towards the head of the village and his wife.

And when the dragon was at the river side, they were surprised! They saw a baby girl inside the basket!

The dragon said, &quot;Please take good care of her very well. She is your daughter and she will be a very important person someday.&quot; The dragon was slowly leaving them.

The head of the village and his wife were very happy.Their wish finally came true. They had a baby! They took care of her and loved her very much.

Until now, people in the area believe that when the baby girl was adult, she married to the King of Kutai Kertanagara, a kingdom in Kalimantan. And the people named the dragon as Erau Dragon. And to commemorate the dragon, people always hold sampan competition. They decorated their sampans like dragons.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="164" name="The Legend of Ponorogo Dance" tags="" position="0,60">A long time ago, there was a kingdom in Kediri, East Java. The king had a beautiful daughter. Her name was Princess Dewi Sanggalangit. She was not only beautiful, but also had a great personality. She liked to help people and she never treated people differently.

Princess Dewi Sanggalangit was single. Although many young men had come to propose her to be their wife, the princess still did not want to get married yet. It made the king restless.

&quot;My daughter, what are you waiting for? You are old enough to get married.&quot;

&quot;I know that, Father. And I will pray to gods to give me guidance,&quot; said the princess. Princess Dewi Sanggalangit did not want to choose the wrong husband. Therefore, she meditated, asking gods to give her guidance on how to choose the right husband.

While during her meditation, the princess had a vision. It was seen that in her wedding party, people enjoyed watching a dance. It was not a common dance that she had seen before.

The dancers were dancing following harmonious melody from the Gamelan. It is a traditional.music instrument in Java. There were also horses lining up, they were following the bride and the groom. And the most interesting attraction was the performance of a two-headed animal!

The princess told the king about her vision during the meditation. The king then made an announcement. He said that any man could realize his daughter&#39;s wish, could marry her.

One by one, they gave up. They said it was very difficult to hold the dance, especially the performance of a two-headed animal. However, there were two men who still wanted to continue. They were King Singabarong from Lodaya Kingdom and King Kelanaswandana from Bandarangin Kingdom.

King Singabarong was a mean king. He would hurt anyone who did not obey him. King Singabarong was very strange. He was a human but he had a lion head. He was a very tall and big man. His head had been hairy just like a lion&#39;s head. There were many fleas on his head, therefore he kept a peacock. He always brought his peacock with him. And whenever he felt itchy, he asked his bird to peck and bit the fleas.

Meanwhile, King Kelanaswandana was a handsome man. He was wise and kind to his people. The King had a great supernatural power. He was still single. And he really loved Princess Dewi Sanggalangit. He was sure that he could hold the dance.

Both kings worked very hard. To anticipate his competitor, King Singabarong sent his soldier to spy King Kelanaswandanana:

The report from his soldier shocked King Singabarong. He said that King Kelanaswandana already had 140 twin horses.

King Singabarong was upset! He planned to attack King Kelanaswandana and stole his horses. Soon King Singabarong and his soldiers arrived at the Kingdom of Bandarangin. Finally the two kings were facing each other.

While they were fighting, suddenly King Singabarong felt very itchy in his head. He could not stand it anymore. He asked his peacock to peck his hairy-lion-head. King Kelanaswandana did not waste the great opportunity. With his supernatural power, he Whipped King Singabarong.

Amazingly, King Singabarong changed into a very strange animal. His peacock joined his head. King Singabarong had changed into a two-headed animal! King Kelanaswandana immediately brought the two-headed animal and performed the dance.

Princess Dewi Sanggalangit amazed and as promised she agreed to marry King Kelanaswandana. And she was brought to Wengker in Bandarangin Kingdom. Wengker was the other name of Ponorogo. Since then people named the dance as Ponorogo dance.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="165" name="Jantur and Menur" tags="" position="672,60">JANTUR and Menur were twins. Jantur was a boy and Menur was a girl and they had different personalities. Jantur was lazy, he got angry easily. He always said bad words when he was angry. However, Menur was a very kind, diligent, patient and always helped their parents. She always reminded her brother to behave well.

“Menur! Where are you? I&#39;m hungry! Give me some food!” said Jantur.

“Be patient Jantur I&#39;m still cooking, the food is not ready yet. Why don&#39;t you help me mop the floor? Father and mother will be home soon,” said Menur.

“Arrrgggh! What took you so long? I’m hungry, you are so slow!” said Janur. 

And he said bad words to Menur.

Menur was very sad. She cried. When their parents went home, Menur told them about Jantur&#39;s bad behavior. Her father then advised him. However, Jantur did not want to listen to him. He ignored him, and it was getting worse. Jantur asked his parents and his sister to leave the house. They were very sad. They never thought that Jantur would ask them to leave the house.

After his parents and his sister left he house, Jantur lived alone. At first he felt very happy because no one disturbed him. He could do anything he wanted. He even spent his parents’ money for bad things. When all the money was gone, he sold his parents animals, cows, goats, cocks and hens.

Meanwhile, Menur and her parents lived in another place. When they left home, they did not bring anything. Because they worked very hard, they could build a new home and they had new animals.
They were rich.

How about Jantur? Soon all his parents’ wealth was gone. Jantur was lazy, he did not want to work. He wanted to have much money in an easy way. So he sold the last wealth, it was the house.

After Jantur sold the house, again, he spent the money foolishly. It was not surprising that Jantur became poor again. He did not have any money and he did not have a house. His body was very thin. He suffered skin disease, his skin was full of black dots.

Jantur did not have a way to go, he just walked and walked. Finally, he arrived at his parents’ house. Menur was in front of the house sweeping the floor. At first, they did not recognize each other. Menur thought that Jantur was a beggar.

“Are you hungry? Here, I have some food,” said Menur.

Jantur was happy. He was so hungry that he did not recognize his sister. However Menur knew him.

“Jantur? Is that you, brother? Father, mother, Jantur is here!!” screamed Menur.

“Jantur my son, what happened to you?” said his mother. Jantur was surprised.

“Mother, is that really you? Father, mother, and Menur! Please forgive me. I was punished by God. I suffer an illness, I’m poor, and I don’t have a house to live. I have done bad things to you all. I promise I will be good,” promised Jantur.

The family now reunited. They have already forgiven Jantur and amazingly Jantur was cured. And as he promised, Jantur became a very good man. </tw-passagedata>

The farmer left his house with a little money. On the way of the harbor, he met an old woman. She brought three cats.

The farmer was confused. he wanted to help the woman, but if he bought her cats, he would not bring any money.

Finally, he decided to buy the cats. The woman was very happy. she gave him a small cage so the farmer could put the cats in it.

Later the farmer was on the ship. At first the cruise was good, but suddenly there was a heavy storm. The ship could not continue the cruise to Java. It harbored in Mice Island. People named it Mice Island because there were so many mice lived in the island. The mice attacked people&#39;s barn and ate their supplies. The people were hopeless. They did not know how to combat the mice.

The farmer heard about the people&#39;s problem with the mice. He remembered about his three cats. he wanted to help the people by giving them his three cats.

The people really welcomed the farmer&#39;s help. And soon the farmer released his three cats. The cats had not eaten for a long time. they were very hungry. And when the cats saw the mice, they immediately chased and ate the mice.

Slowly the number of the mice decreased. the people were very happy. They wanted to repay the farmer&#39;s kindness. They all gave him a lot of money. The farmer was extremely happy. he went back to his home in Madura.

The farmer was not poor anymore. he bought land and his own rice field. He lived happily with his family.

His neighbor was jealous with the farmer. He also wanted to have a lot of money. He heard about the Mice island. So he collected many cats and joined a ship.

Finally he arrived in Mice Island. However, the name of the island was not Mice Island anymore. Its name changed into Cat island. The three cats that the farmer brought had bred. It made the island full of cats.

And so when he offered his cats to the people, they all were laughing at him.

 &quot;What? Are you kidding?! We have too many cats here. we don&#39;t need your cats!&quot;

He was so embarrassed. Finally he went home to Madura and brought his cats back to him.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="167" name="The Legend of Telaga Pasir" tags="" position="0,60">ONCE upon a time, there lived a husband and wife in the jungle of Lawu Mountain, East Java. They were Kyai Pasir and his wife Nyai Pasir. They lived peacefully. Kyai Pasir was a farmer. He worked in a field. Nyai Pasir just stayed at home. Everyday she cleaned up the house and cooked for them.

It was a beautiful morning, Kyai Pasir left the house and went to his field. While he was walking, he stumbled upon something.

He looked at the thing carefully, &quot;What is this? Is this an egg? But what kind of egg is this? It&#39;s very big.&quot;

Kyai Pasir put the egg back to the ground. He continued walking. At home, Kyai Pasir told his wife about the egg.

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you bring the egg home?&quot; asked Nyai Pasir.

&quot;It&#39;s really big. I feel really strange about the egg,&quot; explained Kyai Pasir.

&quot;If the egg is really big, then we both can eat. Please bring the egg home, Kyai,&quot; asked Nyai Pasir.

On the following days, Kyai Pasir went to the field as usual. He planned to bring the egg home as his wife&#39;s request.

Kyai Pasir was walking carefully . he did not want to stumble upon the egg for the second time. He looked around. And aha! He found the egg. He carefully brought the egg home.

&quot;Nyai, this is the egg I told you.&quot;

&quot;You are right, Kyai. The egg is big. I wonder what animal has this egg.&quot;

Nyai Pasit did not wait for long to boil the egg. And when it was done, they both ate the egg.

They both felt very full. And it made them very sleepy. Not long after that they fell asleep. In the morning Kyai and Nyai Pasir woke up as usual. Kyai Pasir took a bath then he went to the field.

On the way to the field, he felt his body so uncomfortable. He felt his body itchy. He stretched his body. Suddenly he felt his throat so hot. He badly needed water. He was screaming in pain.

He was so shocked! he saw his skin changed into scales. Just like scales of reptile. He touched his head. He felt something was growing on his head. He was completely shocked. A horn was growing. And he also had a tail. His body slowly getting bigger. He changed into a dragon!

Meanwhile, at home Nyai Pasir also felt the same. She was so panicked. She was screaming. She was running to the field. She wanted to look for her husband. When she arrived at the field, she saw a dragon was moving his body on the ground.

Slowly Nyai Pasir also changed into a dragon. The two dragons were trying to walk but they were too weak to do that. They just could move their bodies on the ground. They moved their bodies so heavily and it made a very big hole. The hole was getting deeper and deeper. Soon water came out of the hole. The water came out very much. And it made a lake. Since then, people named the lake as Telaga Pasir.</tw-passagedata>

The prince was engaged with a princess from Daha kingdom. Her name was Dewi Candra Kirana. One day, Raden Inu Kertapati planned to visit Daha kingdom. He wanted to meet his fiance.

Raden Inu Kertapati went to Daha kingdom with his guards. While they were riding the horses,suddenly a group of people from Asmarantaka stopped them. The leader was Panji Semirang. Upon hearing their place of origin, Raden Inu Kertapati and his guards were alert. They heard that Asmarantaka was a place of thieves.

&quot;Don&#39;t believe what you heard, Raden. We are not thieves,&quot; said Panji Semirang.

Raden Inu Kertapati felt so strange. He felt he already met and knew Panji Semirang for a long time. He was really familliar with Panji Semirang.

Raden Inu Kertapati then continued his trip to Daha kingdom. When he arrived, the king welcomed him nicely. The king was accompanied by his concubine. Dewi Liku, and their daughter. Her name Dewi Ajeng. However, his fiance was not there. He asked Dewi Liku, &quot;Where is Dewi Candra Kirana?&quot;

Many young men fell in love with her. However, she always refused their marriage proposals. King Brawijaya was sad. He really wanted to see his daughter to get married.

“You have to get married soon, my daughter,” said King Brawijaya.

 He continued, “I’m getting older, I know you are looking for a great husband. I have an idea, I’m going to hold a competition. If a man can stretch Kyai Garudayaksa’s bow and lift Kyai Sekardelima’s gong, he will be your husband.&quot;

Princess Dyah Ayu Pusparani was speechless. She knew her father really wanted her to get married. She just hoped that she would marry a great man. She knew the bow and the gong had supernatural power. So the winner must had supernatural power too.

One by one men tried to stretch the bow and lifted the gong. No one succeeded. They were injured, their hands and backs were broken.

King Brawijaya planned to stop the competition. He thought no one could win the competition. However, before he stopped it, a man came to him.

“Don’t stop the competition now. I haven’t tried it yet.”

Everybody was looking at him. He was very strange. His head was unlike human’s head. He had a bull’s head.

“What’s your name?” asked the king.

“My name is Lembusura.”

Then he tried to stretch the bow, he succeeded. The next test, he had to lift the gong. Again, he succeeded. Everybody applauded. They all were amazed by his power. 

However, Princess Dyah Ayu Pusparani was sad. She never thought that she would marry a man who had a bull’s head. King Brawijaya was also sad. But he had no choice. He had to keep his promise.

Later, he asked his men to prepare a wedding ceremony. The ceremony was getting closer and Princess Dyah Ayu Pusparini was really sad. She really wanted to cancel the wedding. She was thinking very hard. Finally she had an idea. She told his father.

“Father, ask Lembusura to make a well on the top of Kelud Mountain. The well is for me to take a bath,” said Princess Dyah Ayu Pusparini.

King Brawijaya understood the plan. He asked Lembusura to go to the top of Kelud Mountain. Lembusura agreed. When he arrived, Lembusura dug the ground. He was digging until the hole was deep. Suddenly, some soldiers pushed him into the hole. They buried him alive. Lembusura was helpless. He could not do anything.

Before he died, he cursed the King. “King Brawijaya, wait for my revenge. I will destroy your kingdom!” cursed Lembusura.

Everybody was so scared. They really believed that Lembusura would revenge to the kingdom. Until now, every time Kelud Mountain erupts, people say that Lembusura is doing his revenge!</tw-passagedata>

“I need some water for my cattle. They are thirsty.”

“Where are you going to find it?”

“I don’t know.”

It was a very common conversation for people in Magetan, East Java, a long time ago. They did not have enough water.

They needed water for their daily needs, such as taking a bath and washing dishes and clothes. They also needed water for their cattle and trees.

Actually they were quite lucky because the land was fertile. However, since they did not have enough water, the villagers could not plant a lot of trees. Therefore, the villagers sometimes had to walk very far away to fi nd water.

In every morning, the head of the village always asked some young men to find water. In one afternoon, the young men came home with good news.

“There was a water spring far from here. However, it was very difficult to go there.”

“Wol, who dares to go there?” asked the head of the village.

Some young men raised their hands.

“We will go there, Sir.”

Then those young men went to the water spring. they were right. The place was not easy to reach. They had to be very careful.

And finally they arrived. However, they saw a girl was there first. They were surprised. They all thought that a girl could not go there.

“Maybe she is not really human, maybe she is an angel,” said one man.

“Come on, let’s approach her,” said another man.

Strangely, before the men came to her, the girl disappeared.

“Look! She is over there!” he pointed to one place.

They immediately ran to come to her. Again, the girl disappeared.
“Look! What is that? It is shining!”

Exactly on the ground where the girl was standing, they found a big diamond. The diamond was
next to the well. Then they brought home the diamond and a lot of water.

When they showed the diamond to the head of the village, he said, “Our great great grand parents named this kind of diamond as Manikan.”

Then he continued. “Since the diamond was found next to the water spring. So let’s name the water spring as Manikan.”

Everybody agreed. Since then the area was named Manikan. The word Manikan had changed into Panekan. And now Panekan has become a great area in East Java. The people are happy because they have fertile land.</tw-passagedata>

In the small village, there was a young man who lived with his mother. His father died a long time ago. The man’s job was a mask maker. He also fell in love with the princess but he did not have any courage to propose her. The man was ugly.

“How can I propose her? The princess even refused the proposal from handsome and rich men,” that’s what this ugly man always thought.

But he could not stop thinking about her. Days and nights the mask maker always thought the beautiful princess. He did not want to eat and he could not sleep either. Soon, the man was ill.
And that made his mother really worried about him.

“What&#39;s a matter with you? Is there something wrong? Please tell me.”

“I.. I... love the princess, Mother. But I’m not confident enough to express my feelings to her. I’m ugly and I’m sure the princess doesn’t want to marry me.”

The mother replied. “You are a great mask maker. Make a mask of a handsome face and wear it when you propose the princess.”

The man thought it was a great idea. He immediately made the best mask. And when the mask was finished, he wore it. Amazingly the mask really looked like a real face. So he went to the palace confidently.

“Your majesty, I’m here to propose your daughter,” said the man to the king.

“Stay here. I will talk to my daughter,” said the king.

The king then told his daughter that there was a very handsome man wanted to propose her.

“It’s all up to you, Dear. If you love him, you can marry him,” said the king.

And when the princess met the man, she fell in love with him at the first sight. She thought that he was the most handsome man in the world. Later the princess told the king that she accepted the man’s wedding proposal.

At first the man was very happy. His dream finally came true, he could marry the girl of his dream. However, he realized that the princess did not fall in love with him. But she fell in love with his mask. He then planned to tell the truth to the princess and the king. The man was ready with all the risks.

After the man told the truth about the mask, the princess was not angry.

“It is true I love you at the first time we met, because you are so handsome. But after I know you so well, I love you the way you are. Now, I want you to make the same mask you are wearing. I want to wear it in our wedding,” said the princess.

During the wedding, all the guests were surprised to see the bride and the groom were wearing the same masks. And that inspired some people to create a dance and named it Joged Topeng Kembar or Twin Masks Dance. Until now people in Lumajang, East Java, still do the dance. </tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="174" name="The Prince of Frog" tags="" position="0,60">BALI was suffering from a long drought. It was dried everywhere. Some people were sick. They did not have enough water. Children and old people suffered the most and some of them could not hold the pain anymore. Slowly they died. The disaster was also felt by the animal. They were lying very weakly.

People were confused. They did not know what to do. They had been praying and asking gods to send them rain. They needed water badly. But still, rain did not fall yet.

And finally, one of the gods came down to earth. He was the God of Darkness.

&quot;This disaster is a punishment for you all. You no longer care for others. You just think of yourself,&quot; said the God of Darkness.

&quot;We are sorry and we promise to be kind to others. And what should we do to end this disaster?&quot; asked one of the villagers.

&quot;It&#39;s easy. I need one young man who is willing to sacrifice himself. I will change him into a frog. He can sing to make rain fall down. And he can change back into a human if he can find a girl who truly loves him as a frog.&quot;

People were staring at each other. They were not talking, but it was clear that they were looking for a man who was willing to change as a frog. And no one wanted to do it. People almost gave up. The disaster was getting severe and they had to have rain soon. Otherwise more people and more cattle would die.

Prince Putu Oka was very sad to see the condition. He thought he had to do something to end the disaster. And yes... he was willing to sacrifice himself and change into a frog.

The God of Darkness changed prince Putu Oka into a frog. People were very touched to see how he sacrificed for the people. And after he became a frog the prince immediately sang the songs. And it worked! Slowly, the sky became dark. It was full of dark cloud. Then an amazing thing happened. Rain fell down!

People were happy. They had much water. The cattle were fresh. And the rice fields were green. And of course, Prince Putu Oka was also happy. What he did was very beneficial for the people. His sacrifice was not useless. However he slowly became very lonely. He wanted to meet his friends and play with them. But no one wanted to play with a frog.

The prince of frog did not give up. He knew he had to find a girl who loved him then he could change back into human.

The prince started his journey. He arrived at a palace. There was a beautiful girl at the garden. She looked very sad. The prince of frog came to the girl.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter? You looked very sad,&quot; asked the frog.

The girl was surprised to see a frog who could talk like humans. And she finally responded to the frog.

&quot;I lost my ring in the pond. No one can help me. It&#39;s my favorite ring. I&#39;m really sad.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I can help you,&quot; said the frog.

He immediately swam into the pond. He did not have any problem finding the missing ring. And when he found it, he swam to the surface and gave it to the girl.

&quot;Thank you very much. You are the only one who can help me. I really love you,&quot; said the girl.

&quot;Really?&quot; the frog was smiling.

He knew his journey to find a girl who could love him just ended. And he was right, he slowly changed back into a human. The girl was so surprised when the frog changed into a handsome man.

However she was also happy to meet this young and handsome man. They fell in love and later they got married. They lived happily ever after.</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="176" name="Kebo Iwa" tags="" position="823,60">ONCE upon a time in Bali, a man and his wife were praying. They have been married for a long time but did not have any children. They asked God to give them a child. They prayed and prayed.

God finally answered their prayers. The wife, then, got pregnant and they had a baby boy. They were very happy.

The baby was extraordinary. He was very much different from other babies. He ate and drank a lot. Day after day he ate more and more. His body was getting bigger and bigger. And by the time he was a teenager, his body was as big as a buffalo. People then started to call him Kebo Iwa.

Because of his eating habit, Kebo Iwa’s parents spent a lot of money to buy his food in large amount. They finally went bankrupt. They gave up and asked the villagers to help them provide the food.

The villagers then worked together to cook and build a big house for Kebo Iwa. He was like a giant. He could not stay in his parents’ house anymore because of his big body. Sadly, after a few months, the villagers also could not afford to cook him the food. They then asked Kebo Iwa to cook his own food. The villagers just prepared the raw materials.

Kebo Iwa agreed and as an expression of his gratitude to the villagers, he built a dam, dug wells, and he also protected the villagers from animals and people who wanted to attack their village. He did those things by himself.

Meanwhile, the troops of Majapahit were planning to attack Bali. They knew about Kebo Iwa. And they also knew that they could not conquer Bali with Kebo Iwa there. Kebo Iwa was more powerful than they were.

Gajah Mada, the Maha Patih (Chief Minister) of Majapahit then planned something. They were pretending to invite Kebo Iwa to Majapahit to help them dig some wells. They said that Majapahit was suffering from a long dry season and needed much water. Kebo Iwa did not know the plan, so he went to Majapahit.

When Kebo Iwa was busy digging a very big well, the troops covered the well. Kebo Iwa had difficulty in breathing and buried alive. He died in the well.

After the death of Kebo Iwa, Bali was conquered by Majapahit. Until now, people still remember Kebo Iwa because he had done a lot for Majapahit and Bali. The stone head of legendary Kebo Iwa can be found in Pura Gaduh temple in Blahbatuh.</tw-passagedata>

So you don&#39;t have to worry that Kala Rau will kill you. After you drink the water, you will not die,&quot; said pewa Wisnu. Howeve4, one of those giants heard about tirta amerta. He reported to Kala Rau. &quot;Ha..ha.. ha... Now Iknow how to marry Dewi Ratih. I will use their secret!&quot; said Kala Rau.

Dewa Wisnu gathered all the gods and the goddesses in the palace. He put the water in the jug. He asked all the gods and the goddesses to take turn drinking the water. One by one they drank the water. They fett very fresh. It was time for Dewa Kuwera to drink the water. Dewa Wisnu felt there was something strange withDewa Kuwera. He was bigger and talle4 and he was also smelly. Dewa Wisnu did not know that it was not the real Dewa Kuwera. He was Kala Rau disguising as Dewa Kuwera.

One day, a young man came to the village. He came from a very far place.

He went to the richest farmer in the village. The richest farmer&#39;s name was Jero Pasek.

&quot;My name is I Tundung. I came here to work, Sir. I promise I will work hard.&quot;

However, I Tundung accepted it very happy. He felt that Jero Pasek had already trusted him. He wanted to repay his trust by giving him great harvest.

The land on the hill was arid. It was very dry. However, I Tundung was never given up. There was a small spring. I Tundung made irrigation. He used the water in the spring and flew it through the irrigation.

It worked! The ground was not dry anymore. The plants grew very well. And again they delivered an outstanding harvest. Now the whole hills are green, thanks to I Tundung.

&quot;I&#39;m very disappointed in you. I have lost a lot of harvest and animals!&quot;

I Tundung was sad. He went to a temple to pray. While he was meditating, he heard a voice.

&quot;I recognize your problem and I can help you.&quot;

&quot;Thank you. I&#39;m willing to do anything as long as I can protect my master&#39;s harvest and animals.&quot; said I Tundung.

&quot;I will change you into a big black snake. You will live on the hill and you can protect the harvest and the animals.&quot;

I Tundung agreed. He did not want to take his master disappointed and angry at him. Slowly, he changed into a big black snake.

Meanwhile, Joko Pasek was looking for I Tundung. And when he arrived at his field, he saw a big black snake. He was so surprised when the snake was able to speak!

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid, Sir. It&#39;s me, I Tundung. From now on, I will always protect your harvest and your animals.&quot;

Jero Pasek was very distressing. He never meant to ask I Tundung to do anything. But it was too late.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="182" name="I Teruna Tua" tags="" position="0,185">A long time ago there was an old man. His name was I Teruna Tua. He was single. He only wanted to marry a girl whose birthday was the same as his birthday.

It was I Teruna Tua&#39;s birthday. He heard that his friend&#39;s wife just give birth a baby girl. I Teruna visited his friend. His name was Pan Kayan. I Teruna Tua brought his wooden stick.

&quot;I want to put my stick under the baby&#39;s bed. I will take it back late1,&quot; said I Teruna Tua.

&quot;Sure, no problem,&quot; said Pan Kayan. 

Several years latex, I Teruna Tua came to Pan Kayan&#39;s house. He wanted to take his stick back. He was so surprised to see termites had eaten his stick.

&quot;Pan Kayan, the termites have eaten my stick.

Now the termites are mine. However, I will put the termites here. I will get them back later,&quot; said l Teruna Tua.

&quot;That&#39;s OK. You can take the termites back later&quot; said Pan Kayan.

Several years later, I Teruna Tua came to Pan Kayan&#39;shouse. He saw Pan Kayan&#39;s hen was eating the termites.

Several years late{, the hen was fighting with Pan Kayan&#39;s dog. The hen lost the fight. She died.
I Teruna Tua saw the incident.

He said, &quot;Pan Kayan, your dog killed my hen. Now the dog is mine. I want to put the dog here. I will get him back later.&quot;

Several years later, the dog was attacking Pan Kayan&#39;s buffalo. The buffalo was angry. He killed the dog. And again I Teruna Tua saw the incident. 

He said &quot;Your buffalo killed my dog. Now the buffalo is mine. I want to put the buffalo here. I will get him back later.&quot;

The buffalo was sleeping under the mango tree. Unfortunately, a big branch fell down and hit the buffalo&#39;s head. The buffalo

was dead. And I Teruna Tira then again told Pan Kayan that the mango tree belonged to I Teruna Tua.

Years passed by, Pan Kayan&#39;s daughter was a teenager. There were some mangoes in the branches of the tree. She liked to eat mangoes, so she picked all the mangoes. 

I Teruna Tua was surprised when there were no mangoes left. He knew that all the mangoes were eaten by Pan Kayan&#39;s daughter.

&quot;Pan Kayan, your daughter ate my mangoes. She is mine now. I want to marry her.&quot;

Later I Teruna Tua and the girl got married. Later they had a baby. And when the baby was crying, I Teruna Tua tried to cheer her up. He was singing a song about his wife.

Your mother was first a stick, then changed into termites, then changed into a hen, then changed into a dog, then changed into a buffalo, then changed into a mango tree, then finally changed into your mother.&quot;

His wife heard the song. She was angry. She brought the baby and went back to her parents&#39; house.

I Teruna Tua was sad. He tried to persuade his wife to come back to him but she refused it.

Pan Kayan held a ceremony under the mango tree. He gave some offering to the gods
I Teruna Tua was hiding behind the tree. He talked to Pan Kayan as if he was one of the gods.

&quot;l will not accept your offering here. I want you to ask your daughter to give the offerings to her husband.&quot;

Pan Kayan heard the voice. He immediately asked his daughter to bring the offering to I Teruna Tua. And when she met her husband I Teruna Tua apologized and promised not to hurt her heart again. Since then, they have lived happily. </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="183" name="I Cikampeng" tags="" position="0,185">THERE was a rich but stupid man. His name was I Cikampeng. He had a lot of money because he never wasted it. He was very careful in spending his money.

For example, he never took a bath in the bathroom and never bought any soap. If he wanted to take a bath, he only went to the river. He thought taking a bath with water and soap in the bathroom only wasted his money. He also did not have any utensils.

If he wanted to eat, he just bought a little rice and he divided the rice into three very small parts. They were for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. That was why his body was so skinny. He also only had one clothes. He kept on wearing it even though it was already worn-out.

One day I Cikampeng went to a wedding party. People asked why he did not get married yet. He said that actually he wanted to get married soon. He was still looking for the perfect girl. He wanted to marry a girl who did not like to waste money.

Someone said that there was a girl I Cikampeng was looking for. Her name was I Mayang Sari. And she was as skinny as I Cikampeng. 

Soon I Cikampeng went to visit I Mayang Sari. He fell in love with her and asked her to marry him. I Mayang Sari agreed. She had been waiting for a man to marry her. Later I Cikampeng and I Mayang Sari got married. 

I Cikampeng did not know that I Mayang Sari was suffering a terrible disease. Because she did not get enough food from I Cikampeng, her disease was getting terrible. She was dying. And finally she was dead.

It was in the morning. I Cikampeng wanted to go to the rice field. He woke his wife up. He thought that she was still sleeping. In the afternoon, I Cikampeng saw his wife was still in the bed. I Cikampeng was happy. He could save the food for tomorrow because his wife was still sleeping.

It happened on the following days. He always thought that his wife was still sleeping. In the mean time, his wife&#39;s body started to decay and produced a very bad smell.

The neighbors asked I Cikampeng where his wife was. And they also asked why there was a bad smell coming from his house. I Cikampeng said that his wife was sleeping. The neighbors were suspicious. They wanted to see his wife. And when they saw her, they were very surprised.

&quot;I Cikampeng, your wife is dead! Don&#39;t you smell it?&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; asked I Cikampeng. He was very stupid. 

Since then he thought that when someone smelled very bad as it meant that the person was dead. I Cikampeng and the neighbors buried I Mayang Sari. And when they have finished, they all went home. In the evening, I Cikampeng was farting. The smell was very bad. I Cikampeng then remembered what the people said about the bad smell.

He thought he was dead. He did not want to tell his neighbors that he was dead. He had to spend some money when he asked the neighbors to bury his wife. He did not want to waste his money, therefore he wanted to bury his body by himself.

He dug the ground and when it was deep enough, he slowly covered his body with the soil. And finally almost all parts of his body were covered by soil. Except for his head, it was not covered yet.

When people saw I Cikampeng, they asked what happened. He told them everything. The people were laughing. They all said that I Cikampeng was very stupid!</tw-passagedata>

Although they were poor, they were happy. Nang Butuh Mosel was a good father. He loved his children very much. He always taught his children to be kind to others.

Nan Butuh Mosel did not have a permanent job. He got some money by helping others. And he always worked at the market.

One day he went to the market. On the way there, a man was trying to kill a snake. The man said that the snake ate his chicken.

Nang Butuh Mosel felt sorry for the snake. He wanted to save the snake by buying it from him. The man agreed. Nang Butuh Mosel gave him some money and later he put the snake inside his bag. Later he continued his trip to the market. Suddenly he saw a man was trying to kill a mouse. The man said the mouse always ate his rice. Nang Butuh Mosel felt sorry, he bought the mouse and put him inside his bag.

And when he continued his trip to the market, he saw a man was trying to kill a cat and a dog. He said the cat and the dog always ate his fish. Again Nang Butuh

Mosel saved their lives by buying them. He put the cat and the dog in his bag. He did not have any money. He already spent all his money buying the animals.

Nang Butuh Mosel was tired. He rested under a big tree. He fell asleep. And when he woke up, there was a very big snake in front of him. The snake was able to talk!

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid, Sir. I&#39;m the mother of the snake you saved. I want to thank you, here please accept my ring. It is a magic ring. Whatever the thing you insert through the ring, it will change into gold,&quot; said the big snake.

Nang Butuh Mosel opened his bag. The snake went out and followed his mother. He was very curious. He took a small twig and inserted it through the ring. Amazingly the twig changed into gold!
He was so happy and later he went home. He also brought the mouse, the cat and the dog with him. He wanted to give those animals to his children as their pets.

At home Nang Butuh Mosel and his wife started to change everything into gold. Later they became very rich. They did not tell anyone about the ring, including their children.

Unfortunately his children played with the ring. It fell and broke into two pieces. Nang Butuh Mosel was not angry. He just advised them to be careful when playing. Nang Butuh Mosel brought the broken ring to a goldsmith. And after the ring was fixed, a piece of string accidentally was inserted through the ring. The string charged into gold.

The goldsmith was surprised. He had a bad plan. He exchanged the magic ring into an ordinary ring. And when Nang Butuh Mosel came to take his ring, he received the ordinary ring. His magic ring was kept by the goldsmith. Nang Butuh Mosel finally found out that his magic ring was exchanged. He was sad. The pets felt so sorry to see their master sad. They knew about the magic ring. They wanted to help and got the magic ring back.

They went to the goldsmith&#39;s house. The dog used his nose to trace the ring. They found the magic ring was inside a box. The mouse used his teeth to open the box. It made a noise. The goldsmith woke up from his sleep. The cat then made a sound of miaow. The goldsmith thought it was just a cat, he went back to sleep.
After they got the magic ring, they went back home. They gave the ring to Nang Butuh Mosel.
He was so happy and thanked them. This time he kept it very carefully.</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="186" name="The Legend of Catu Island" tags="" position="679,71">A long time ago there was a village in Bali. The people worked as farmers. One of the was Jurna. He was a diligent farmer. He always had a great harvest. However he was never satisfied. He wanted to have better and better harvest.

&quot;I will promise to gods. If they give me better harvest than I have now, I will give them offerings and I will share the harvest to the neighbors,&quot; said Jurna to his wife.

&quot;I agree, But remember, you have to keep your promise,&quot; said his wife.

Soon, Jurna had better harvest. He had more rice than he had before. He was happy. And as promised, he prepared offerings to the gods and he also shared to his neighbors. They were very happy.

Jurna was not satisfied. He wanted to have better and better and more harvest. Therefore he promised to gods that he would double his offerings and his sharing to the neighbors.

His wish came true. His harvest was much better than before. The other farmers were amazed. They were also very thankful because he shared his harvest to them.

One day, Jurna went to his rice field. When he arrived, he saw a pile of soil on the ground. It looked like a catu. Catu was made of coconut shell. People used catu to measure the amount of rice. At home, Jurna talked about a soil which looked like a catu to his wife. She had an idea.

&quot;Let&#39;s make catu from rice,&quot; she said. Jurna agreed. Later they formed the rice just like catu. On the following day, Jurna went to his rice field. He saw the soil catu was getting bigger.

&quot;Hmm...I will make rice catu bigger than this,&quot; said Jurna himself. He asked his wife to make bigger rice catu. He felt very satisfied. He wanted to show his rise catu to his neighbors. He hoped that his neighbors would prise him as a rich man. And they did! All the neighbors praised him. Jurna became arrogant. On the next day, Jurna went to his rice field. He hoped the soil catu were not getting bigger and bigger. But he was wrong. Strangely, the soil catu was bigger.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I have much rice. I can make rice catu bigger,&quot; said Jurna arrogantly. While he was making the rice catu, he was thinking how the neighbors would prise him.

And his wish came true. All the neighbors were so amazed by the size of the rice catu. They all said that Jurna was very rich. Jurna became more arrogant.

Then Jurna went to his rice field. He hoped the soil catu would stop growing. But he was wrong. Again, it became much bigger than before. Jurna was really upset. He made rice catu bigger than before.

It always repeated. Every time he went to his rice field he always found the soil catu became bigger and bigger.

His wife always reminded him to stop making rice catu. She said that their stock was getting lesser and lesser. She asked him to stop wasting the rice.

But Jurna ignored her. He was only thinking how he could make his rice catu bigger than the soil catu. Soon he lost all of his rice. He became poor. He regretted his bad behaviour. Meanwhile the soil catu became very big. It was like a hill. People then named it as Catu Hill or Bukit Catu.</tw-passagedata>

The king asked his daughter to choose carefully. Some of the men were princes from other kingdom. The king did not want to make the men disappointed and it would start a war.

Putri Luh Cendrasari understood. She held a competition. She would marry a man who could bring her the eyes and the scales of a white dragon. All the participants agreed. They started to look for a white dragon.

It was not easy to find a white dragon. Some of them climbed the mountains and some of them swam in the sea. However they still could not find the white dragon. One by one the participants gave up.

One of the participants was Manik Angkeran. He was not a prince. He was just a villager. Manik Angkeran really wanted to marry Putri Luh Cendrasari. Actually the princess also fell in love with Manik Angkeran.

She really hoped he could win the competition. Manik Angkeran went to his teacher in his cave. The teacher was meditating. Manik Angkeran told his teacher about Putri Luh Cendrasari and the competition.

&quot;What will you do to win the competition?&quot; asked the teacher.

&quot;I will do anything, Master. If I have to sacrifice my soul, yes... I will do it, said Manik Angkeran.

&quot;I really admire your persistence. I can see that you really love her. And I also really love you, Manik Angkeran. And I will do anything to make you happy.&quot;

The teacher continued, &quot;Actually I am a white dragon. Gods allowed me to be human,&quot; said the teacher.

Later an amazing things happened. The teacher slowly turned into a white dragon. Manik Angkeran was very surprised. He did not know that his teacher actually a white dragon.

The white dragon took out his eyes and shook his body. The scales fell off. He gave his eyes and his scales to Manik Angkeran. Then the white dragon disappeared. He went back to heaven.

Manik Angkeran was very sad. He lost his beloved teacher. He immediately went to the palace. The princess was happy. The winner was Manik Angkeran. They soon got married.

Not long after that the princess was pregnant. Everybody was happy except Manik Angkeran. He knew he had to fulfill his promise. He would die soon.

Manik Angkeran was talking to Putri Luh Cendrasari. Suddenly he fell down. Putri Luh Cendrasari saw the gods took manik Angkeran&#39;s spirit.

She cried. She asked gods not to take her husband. She told gods that she wanted to follow her husband. She also wanted to die.

The Gods answered, &quot;It&#39;s not your time to die. You are pregnant.&quot;

&quot;But I really want to be with my husband,&quot; said the princess.

Actually the gods did not want to take Manik Angkeran&#39;s spirit. They just want to test the princess if she really loved him, knowing that he was just a villager, The gods answered her request. Slowly Manik Angkeran came back to life.

He lived again. Since then Manik angkeran and Putri Luh Cendrasari lived happily ever after.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="188" name="Manik Angkeran" tags="" position="0,185">A long time ago, lived a very rich family in Bali. The father was Sidi Mantra. He was very famous for his supernatural power. He lived happily with his wife and his only child Manik Angkeran. Manik Angkeran was a spoiled son. He also had a bad habit. He liked to gamble.

Because of his bad habit, his parents soon became poor. They always advised Manik Angkeran to stop his bad habit, but he never listened to them. Instead he kept on begging for his parents to give him a lot of money.

The parents then did not have the heart to see him begging. Sidi Mantra then went to Agung Mountain. There lived a mighty dragon with his great supernatural power. He could provide jewelries to those who could say the right prayers and ring the bell. Sidi Mantra had the bell and he also knew the prayers.

&quot;My name is Sidi Mantra. I have a problem. My son likes to gamble. He made me poor. And now he asks a lot of money. I want to give him some, but now I want him to promise to stop his bad behavior,&quot; explained Sidi Mantra after he met the dragon.

Sidi Mantra then said the prayers and rang the bell. Suddenly, jewelries came out from the dragon&#39;s body. He was very happy and immediately brought the jewelries home. This time Sidi Mantra wanted Manik Angkeran really to stop gambling.

The son then promised. But soon he broke the promise and he did not have any money again. He heard that his father got the jewelries from the dragon living in Agung Mountain. So he stole his father&#39;s bell then went there.

After arriving at Agung Mountain, Manik Angkeran rang the bell. The dragon knew him.

&quot;I will give you anything you want but you have to promise to stop gambling. Remember the karma!&quot; then the dragon gave him the jewelries.

Manik Angkeran was very happy. Suddenly he had a bad idea. He wanted to kill the dragon and stole all his jewelries. The dragon knew his plan and with his great power he killed Manik Angkeran. Sidi Mantra was very sad. He asked the dragon to bring his son back to life. The dragon agreed but they had to live in different places.

After a few moments, Manik Angkeran lived again. Then Sidi Mantra used a stick to make a big line between them on the ground.

From the line, water flowed. Soon it became a river. Finally it became a strait. It separated Java and Bali. People then named the strait as Bali Strait.</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="190" name="Princess Mandalika" tags="" position="0,60">ONCE upon a time, there was a kingdom in Lombok. The king had a very beautiful daughter. Her name was Princess Mandalika. She was very beautiful; many young men fell in love with her.

Princes from all over the place wanted to marry her. One by one, they came to propose her. Princess Mandalika was a kind girl. She hated to make people sad. So, when those princes came to propose her to be their wives, she was very confused. She could not decide, and she also did not want to make them sad.

The king then held a competition at the Seger Kuta beach, Lombok. He asked all the princes to take part in an archery competition. The rule was simple: whoever shot the target perfectly, he could be the husband of his beautiful daughter.

One by one, all participants tried their best. They all wanted to be the winners. After several times, there was no winner. All the participants were great. Those prices were great at archery.
Because there was no one a winner, then they started to argue. They claimed to be the best. The argument was getting hotter and hotter. Finally, they all were fighting. Soon, the fighting was bigger. It was like a war, because all princes brought their soldiers in the archery competition.

Princess Mandalika was really worried. She did not want the war to get bigger and hurt many people. Finally, she had an idea.

&quot;Everybody, listen up! I know you all love me and want me to be your wife. But I can&#39;t be all your wives. I don&#39;t want you to fight because of me. And I don&#39;t want you to be sad either. I want you all to have me, but not as your wives. I want to be someone that everybody can have. I want to be useful for you. I want to be nyale that you all can enjoy together,&quot; said Princess Mandalika.

The king and all other people on the beach did not understand what she meant. The king then came to her. But before he came closer to his daughter, Princess Mandalika jumped to the sea. She was disappeared in the big waves.

It was chaos on the beach. People were screaming. All the princes tried to swim to find the princess. But no one dared to jump in the sea, the waves were too high.

After several hours trying to search the princess, suddenly they found a lot of sea worms on the beach. The king then realized that his daughter had returned as sea worms. Later he named the worms as nyale.

Until now, people in Lombok always try to catch nyale. Nyale is very delicious and that is why more and more people come to Lombok to catch it. However, they cannot catch it anytime they want. They can only find it once a year, in February or March. The tradition to catch the sea worms is called Bau Nyale. </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="191" name="The Broken-hearted Peacock" tags="" position="554,71">A long time ago, all animals lived peacefully. They 
were friends one to another. The birds lived happily. They all liked to help each other.

The most beautiful bird was the peahen. She lived in Java Island. All birds were amazed by her beauty.

The peahen did not have a mate yet. She was waiting for a handsome bird to marry her. And one day, an eagle came to her.

The eagle told her about a handsome bird living on Sumbawa Island. His name was Santoana. The eagle said that Santoana was perfect to be her husband. The peahen ignored the news. She thought Sumbawa was very far from Java. And it was very difficult for her to meet Santoana.

However, later she had the same news from the pigeon. She told peahen about Santoana who was very handsome. The pigeon also said that Santoana was the perfect husband for the peahen.

Again, the peahen ignored the news. She was still thinking about the distance she had to fly if she wanted to meet Santoana.

But she then changed her mind when she heard the parrot told her the same news. All of her friends told her about this handsome bird. And finally the peahen decided to fly to Sumbawa to meet Santoana.

The peahen flew happily. When she was tired, she stopped flying. She asked other birds where Sumbawa Island was.

&quot;Mr Cockatoo, where is Sumbawa Island?&quot;

&quot;You just go straight ahead. You can find Sumbawa Island,&quot; said the cockatoo.

The peahen was happy. She continued to fly. And when she was not sure with the direction, she always asked other birds.

The answer was always the same. She just had to fly straight ahead. And finally she arrived on Sumbawa Island. Her heart beat so fast.

She landed on a beach. There was a bird there. The peahen approached the bird. The people of Sumbawa called the bird as Bongarasang.

&quot;Excuse me, Sir. Do you know where I can meet Santoana?&quot; asked the peahen.

Bongarasang was amazed by her beauty. He instantly fell in love with her. He had a bad plan.

&quot;Well, I am Santoana. Why are you looking for me?&quot; asked Bongarasang.

The peahen was so disappointed. Santoana was not as handsome as she imagined. But because she already made up her mind to marry Santoana, she decided to stay on Sumbawa Island.

Later, the peahen and Bongarasang got married. The peahen did not know that Bongarasang lied to her. Later the couple had a peachick. They were very happy. They held a party and invited all the birds in the island. The party was almost started.

Suddenly the owl said, &quot;Don&#39;t start the party now Santoana is not here yet. He will be here soon.&quot;
Later Santoana came to the party. He was very handsome. The feather was very beautiful. And he also had great voice.

The peahen was very surprised! She asked Bongarasang and he finally told the truth. The peahen was very sad. She decided to go back to Java. Her peachick was very ashamed. He was always hiding and avoiding other birds. The people of Sumbawa then named the peahen’s chick as Bertong.

Meanwhile, Santoana really regretted that he did not have a chance to meet the peahen earlier. He was very sad and he never flew again. Since then, he had become a jungle-fowl.

He was a chicken who had beautiful feather and a great voice. The peahen never came back to Sumbawa, that&#39;s why people said that until now we cannot see peafowls live on Sumbawa Island.</tw-passagedata>

La Golo grew as a spoiled boy. He was lazy and disobedient to his parents. He only loved to play and never wanted to help his parents.

The father was so upset to see La Golo&#39;s behavior. He was so disappointed with him. He wanted La Golo to leave the house! The father had a plan.

&quot;I want to ask him to accompany me to go hunting in the jungle. Later I would leave him alone there said the father to himself.

La GoIo was happy when his father asked him to go hunting. He loved hunting. He brought his arrow. He was ready to catch some animals.

They arrived in the jungle. When La Golo was busy looking for the animals, his father slowly left him.

La Golo was lost! He was looking for his father.

&quot;Father! Where are you? Father!&quot;

No answer. La Golo suddenly realized that his father had planned this. He was so sad. He regretted his bad behavior.

La Golo kept on looking. Suddenly, he met a boy. His name was Sandari. They introduced themselves and together they were looking for the way to go home.

<tw-passagedata pid="193" name="King Laku Leik and Ono Muti" tags="" position="292,196">ONCE upon a time there was a mean king. His name was King Laku Leik. He behaved very badly. He liked to gamble, got angry easily, and often hit people who did not obey him.

King Laku Leik wanted to be a king forever. He did not want anybody to replace him and not even his own son. Therefore he always told his wife that if they had a baby boy, the king would kill him!

The queen was pregnant. She was very happy however she was also worried.

She hoped the baby would be a girl. She did not want her husband to kill their own child.

The king would go hunting. Before he left, he said to his wife, &quot;Re- &quot;.&#39; member, kill the baby if he is a boy. Bury him in&#39;the backyard!&quot; ordered the king.

The queen was helpless when &#39;she heard the king&#39;s request. She just wished that the baby would be a girl. Unfortunately, she did not get her wish come true. She had a baby boy! The queen was so confused. She did not know what to do. She loved her baby son and she did not have the heart to kill him.

The queen went to Feto Ikun&#39;s house. He was the king&#39;s younger brother. Unlike his brother, Feto Ikun was wise, kind, and helpful to people. He refused to live in the palace with the king. Well, Feto Ikun was the only person that the king could not order. People said that it was because Feto Ikun had a magical power. That was why the king was afraid of him.

Feto Ikun was angry when the queen told him that she had to kill her baby son.

&quot;I know what to do,&quot; said Feto Ikun. He continued,

&quot;Leave your baby here and I will take care of him. You can come and visit him later. In the mean time, build a grave in the backyard. Tell your husband that the baby was a boy and you already killed him. Show him the grave.&quot;

The queen understood. She immediately went back to the palace. She built a grave in the backyard.

When the king arrived ftom hunting, he asked, &quot;How&#39;s the baby? A boy or a girl?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a boy and I already killed him. Let me show you the grave,&quot; said the gueen.

The king believed when he saw the grave

Time passed by and the queen&#39;s son was getting bigger. She named him Onu Muti. He became a strong and powerful young man. He was also wise and kind to people. His uncle had taught him how to be a good man. He also taught him about magical power.

One day the king held a cock-fight competition. He invited many people to come and join the competition. Feto Ikun heard about the event.

He said, &quot;Onu Muti it&#39;s time for you to meet your own father. Go to the palace and bfing this cock. Please also bring this gold. Use thistogamble with the king.&quot;

Onu Muti arrived at the palace. He immediately challenged the king.

&#39;Your Majesty, i want to challenge you!&quot; said Onu Muti bravely.

&quot;Hahaha... what do you have?&quot; mocked the king.

He did not know that he was facing his own son. However Onu Muti knew that the king was his father.

His unde already told him. &quot;I have gold, Your Majesty! If i lose, i will give you my gold. But if you lose, you have to give me your kingdom!&quot;

The king was upset. He felt being humiliated and underestimated. He accepted the challenge.

&quot;Sure, I agree!&quot; said the king.

Soon, the two cocks were fighting. It was not too difficult for Onu Muti&#39;s cock to beat the king&#39;s cock. Onu Muti won!

The king was angry! He asked, &quot;Who are you?&quot;

Suddenly, Feto Ikun showed up.

He said, &quot;He is your own son. Your wife did not kill him, you can dig the grave to find out

The king immediately dug the grave, and there was nothing inside!

&quot;Now you have to give him your kingdom. Otherwise, we will kill you!&quot; said Feto Ikun.

The king was terrified. He knew there was nothing he could do. He gave his kingdom and let his son to be the new king. Since then people lived happily and peacefully. Onu Muti was a great king. He led his people wisely.</tw-passagedata>

&quot;That&#39;s it? You only give God betel leaves?&quot; mocked King Daha.

&quot;God, I will give you a cow with golden horns,&quot; said King Daha arrogantly.

Later, their wives were pregnant. And almost at the same time, the queen delivered their babies. King Keling had a handsome baby boy while King Daha had a beautiful baby girl.

And they did their promises to God. King KeIing gave God a buffalo with golden horns. It was more than he promised to God. However, King Daha only gave a normal buffalo and it did not have golden horns. King Daha gave less than he already promised to God.

People had warned King Daha. They were afraid that God would be angry. And unfortunately, it happened! God sent heavy wind to King Daha&#39;s palace. The wind blew &amp;e baby girl away. King Daha was so-sad but it was too late.

Meanwhile, the baby girl landed in a front yard of a farmer&#39;s house. He was so happywhen he saw a beautiful baby girl was sleeping on the front yard. He and his wife did not have any children. Then they named the giil as Cilinaya.

King Keling told Prince Panji that his wife was murdered by a criminal. Prince Panji was so sad and suddenly he heard a whisper. The voice said that he should put his wife&#39;s body in a coffin and put it in the river. The voice also said that he would meet his wife again.

Later tle water in the river drifted the coffin. It stopped at King Daha&#39;s kingdom. With his power, King Daha cured Cilinaya. And she was back to life! King Daha and his wife did not know that Cilinaya was their daughter. They loved her and asked her to stay in the palace.

Years later, King Daha held a party. He also challenged people for cockfight. Nobody could beat King Daha&#39;s cock. And a little boy came. His name was Prince Megatsih. He was the son of Prince Panji and Cilinaya!

Prince Megatsih&#39;s cock beat King Daha&#39;s cock. And strangely the cock sang a song, &quot;Prince Megatsih&#39;s father is Prinje Panji and his mother is Cilinaya,&quot; sang the cock.

People were surprised. And it was clear when Prince Panji came. He was so happy to see his wife was in a good condition. Cilinaya was also happy to meet her husband antl her son again. Then she told King Daha about his father. Cilinaya said that the farmer was not her real father. She was told that wind blew her when she was a baby.

&quot;Please take care of our children. I won&#39;t to be long in the market. I will go to the rice field after I finish selling the harvest,&quot; said the father.

&quot;I will be careful,&quot; said the mother.

&quot;Okay, Mother,&quot; said the children.

Later the mother was busy pounding the rice. It was quite noisy. Strangely, every time the mother pounded the rice, the stone where the children were sitting down was growing. The children were scared. They screamed.

&quot;Mother? The stone is getting taller!&quot; They screamed.

The mother could not hear them well. She thought the children asked her to go home.

&quot;Just the minutes kids, I will finish this soon,&quot; said the mother.

&quot;But mom, the stone is getting taller. We were scared,&quot; the children were crying.

&quot;Be patient, I will finish pounding the rice soon,&quot; said the mother.

Again, she could not hear them well. It was repeated again and again. The golog stone was getting taller and taller and finally it reached the clouds. The children could not be seen it anymore.

When the mother finished pounding the rice, she was shocked! She could not find her children. She was crying. She then prayed to God. She wanted to bring her children down but she did not know how to do it. Somehow God answered her pray. She had to use the rice pounder to cut down the Golog stone.

Then she hit the stone with the rice pounder. Amazingly, the stone broke down into three pieces. The first part fell in an area which later called Gembong Village. The second part fell in area which was later named Dasan Batu, and the last part fell in area which later was named Montong Teker. Unfortunately, the two children could not come back to their mother.

Based on the tradition at Kampung Najo, the birth of a child should not be through the normal birth process, but must go through the &#39;surgical operation&#39; by using a knife made of a bamboo. The tradition was carried out by local people to avoid the risk of maternal death.

Later, Epa stomach cut open by a midwife. She gave birth to twins. Strangely, one baby was a male, while the other was a baby lizard.

Epa and her husband, Wake, named their baby boy as Gerong while the baby lizard named Ora. Ora in the local language means lizard.

The different form of the twin brothers was grown with love and care of their parents. However, in  the growth process, Ora slowly show aggressive and violent nature.

Begin with the habit of eating rice &#39;rampi&#39; which made from Gebang fruit trees, Ora character and appetite was slowly changing. He became malignant and often prey on people&#39;s pets.

All villagers expelled Ora due to the increasingly its dangerous attitude. He went and settled in the forest.

Though exiled from home, Ora still came to the village to meet its twin brother, Gerong. Until now, the relationship between the Komodo dragon with locals still intimate and emotionally felt very close.

The feeling is so strong and almost impossible perceived by outsiders or people who visit the village of Komodo. However, for the people of Komodo, the ancient animals are treated like siblings. They are not hostile to each other, instead, they respect each other.

Komodo may come in and roam freely in the village and could stay under the stage of the houses without being disturbed by the bustle of local residents. Locals also never feel disturbed or concerned the existence of ancient animal in their midst.

The local people considered the Komodo dragons as their ancestors and they honor them every year with a special ritual called &#39;aru gele&#39; by pounding the gebang fruit.

The traditional ceremony &#39;aru gele&#39; was a symbol for recalling Ora and Gerong’s parents who once had to feed their children with gebang fruits.</tw-passagedata>

&quot;We&#39;re going fishing,&quot; said the mouse deer.

&quot;Hmm... It&#39;s interesting. May I join you guys? I&#39;m hungry now.&quot;

&quot;Sure, no problem. The more the merrier,&quot; said the mouse deer.

They were led by the mouse deer. They were walking happily.

Finally, they arrived at the river. They all jumped to the river and caught the fish. After they caught the fish they threw the fish to the river side. The buffalo was still standing at the river side. The mouse deer asked him to guard the fish they caught.

The buffalo did his job carefully. He was collecting all the fish his friends threw to the river side. Suddenly a tiger came.

The tiger was hungry. And when he saw a lot of fish in front him, his mouth was watering. The tiger tried to steal the fish. The buffalo was angry. He attacked the tiger. They were fighting.

Unfortunately, the buffalo lost the fight. He fainted. The tiger, then ate all the fish. The mouse deer finally knew what happened. He asked his friends to keep on catching the fish and throwing them to the riverside. He knew the buffalo could not guard the fish anymore. He then asked the deer to guard the fish.

Sadly, the tiger came. The deer and the tiger were fighting.
The deer also could not win the fight. The tiger again ate the fish that the mouse deer and his friends threw to the river side.

The mouse deer saw the deer fainted. So he next asked the hog. Again, the hog could not win the fight against the tiger.

Then mouse deer asked the elephant to guard the fish. The same thing happened. The elephant also lost the fight. Next, the rhinoceros and the bear had to guard the fish. Unfortunately they also lost the fight.

There were only the mouse deer and the turtle. The mouse deer did not want to ask his best friend to fight against the tiger. So he guarded the fish by himself.
Later the mouse deer collected some rattans. He made big rings from the rattans. He wore the big rings in his legs.

And then he looked up to the sky. Later the tiger came. He wanted to steal the fish again. However, he was curious why the mouse deer was Iooking above in the sky.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot;

&quot;If you wear the big rings, you can see what happens in the sky,&quot; said the mouse deer.

The tiger was curious, so he wore the rings.

&quot;Hey, I still cannot see anything,” said the tiger.

&quot;That&#39;s because you don&#39;t wear enough rings. Your body is big, so you have to wear many rings. Here, let me help you,&quot; said the mouse deer.

The mouse deer put all the rings to the tiger&#39;s legs. All the legs were full of rings. The tiger could not move his legs at all.

He was just lying hopelessly. The mouse deer was happy, the tiger could not disturb them anymore.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="214" name="The Legend of Ruai Bird" tags="" position="1045,585">ONCE upon a time, there was a kingdom in West Kalimantan. The King had seven daughters. The queen had passed away. The king did not want to remarry.

The seven daughters were beautiful. However, the youngest daughter was the most beautiful. She was also the kindest. She often helped other people. Her sisters were very much different. They were lazy. They also had bad attitude. They were cruel to people.

The king knew about his daughters behaviours. He often advise his older daughter to behaviours. He often advise his older daughters to behave like the youngest daughter. Sadly, they never listened to the king&#39;s advice. They hated their youngest sister because the king often praised her good behaviour.

The older daughters often did terrible things to the youngest daughter. They often hit her. She was very sad. She often cried. She could not tell it to her father because her older sisters always intimidated her. They would hit her even harder if she told their father.

One day, the king asked all her daughters to meet him.

&quot;I&#39;m going to the neighboring kingdom. I&#39;ll go for several months. While I&#39;m gone, my youngest daughter will rule the kingdom. Do you understand?&quot; asked the king.

&quot;Yes, we do, Father, &quot;said all the daughters.

The older daughters were angry. They very upset about their youngest sister was asked to rule the kingdom.

After the king left, they planned something bad. They wanted to get rid of their youngest sister. They pretended to be nice to her. The youngest daughter was happy. Finally, her older sisters were nice to her.

The older sisters asked her to go fishing. They asked to go to Gua Batu or a stone cave. There was a river flowing inside the cave. And there were a lot of fish in that river.

The youngest daughter was so happy when they finally arrived at the cave. She did not know that her sisters were going to do something bad to her.

&quot;Hurry up, let&#39;s go inside the cave. You can find a lot of fish inside the cave,&quot; said the oldest daughter.

The youngest was so eager. As she went inside the cave, she did not know that her sisters stayed outside the cave. They kept on asking her to go inside the cave.

She kept on walking until she was lost! She was calling out all her sisters, but they did not respond. She then understood that her sisters did not want her to rule the kingdom anymore.

She was very sad. She cried. Suddenly an old man came. He was a holy man. He was meditating in the cave. She changed her tears into eggs.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I can help you. You can go back to the kingdom but you have to change into a bird. I name you Ruai Bird. After that, brood these eggs. After they hatch, the birds will accompany you,&quot; said the old man.

She agreed. Slowly she changed into a beautiful bird. And after all the eggs were hatched, they went back to the kingdom. They all stayed at the tree near the kingdom. They all saw how the king punished the older sisters.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="215" name="The Greedy Fisherman" tags="" position="1190,195">A long time ago in Sintang, West Kalimantan, lived a fisherman with his family. The fisherman was poor.

Everyday he went fishing in the river using his fishing rod, because he did not have a net. That was why he always caught a few fish.

In one morning the fisherman rowed his sampan in the river. As always, he brought his fishing rod. He stopped his sampan and put the bait.

He was waiting but no fish caught the bait yet. He changed the bait. He hoped this time a fish would catch the bait. Sadly, he was not lucky yet.

After waiting for a long time, finally he felt that a fish caught his bait.

“Aha!” he said. He slowly pulled the string of his fishing rod. It was hard!

The fisherman could not pulled the string.

&quot;Wow! The fish must be very big!&quot; the fisherman thought.

He was thinking about the size of the fish. He knew that the big fish was very expensive. He hoped he would get a lot of money if he could sell the fish.

After thinking about the money, he suddenly had more power to pull the string of his rod. He pulled the rod with great power, but still, he did not succeed. The fisherman was very tired, he had been pulling with great power. The fisherman decided to get some rest.

It was almost dark, the fisherman thought that he already had enough rest. He hoped that the fish would be weak.

He took a deep breath and counted, one, two, three! He pulled the String, and yes! This time he succeeded! He lifted the fishing rod.

He wanted to see the size of the fish. However, he did not see any fish! Instead, he found some wire on the hook. At first he was very disappointed. But when he looked at the wire carefully, he was so happy. The wire was made of gold. He wanted to sell the wire and had a lot of money. So he pulled the wire, he pulled more and more wire. The wire covered all area in his sampan.

Suddenly, there was a voice.

“Enough, don’t take the wire anymore”.

The fisherman ignored the voice. He wanted to take the gold wire as much as he could. He wanted to be rich.

“Enough! Don’t take the wire anymore, stop now!” Again, the voice asked him to stop.

“No! I don’t want to stop now!” said the fisherman.

He continued pulling the gold wire. The sampan was filled with the gold wire. It could not hold the wire anymore. Slowly, the sampan sunk to the bottom of the river. The fisherman did not realize that because he was busy pulling the wire.

When he found out what happened, it was too late. The sampan was completely sunk and the fisherman panicked! He wanted to save the wire but the sampan sunk very fast. Finally, the fisherman swam to the river side. He regretted his bad behavior.

People heard about the fisherman and his wire. Since then people named the river as Wire River or Sungai Kawat. </tw-passagedata>

One day, the mother asks the girl to accompany her to go to the market to buy some food. At first the girl refuses, but the mother persuades her by saying they are going to buy new clothes. The girl finally agrees. But she asks her mother to walk behind her. She doesn&#39;t want to walk side by side with her mother.

Although her mother is very sad, she agrees to walk behind her daughter.
On the way to the market, everybody admires the girl&#39;s beauty. They are also curious. Behind the beautiful girl, there is an old woman with a simple dress. The girl and her mother look very different!

&quot;Hello, pretty lady. Who is the woman behind you?&quot; asks them. “She is my servant,” answers the girl.

The mother is very sad, but she doesn&#39;t say anything. The girl and the mother meet other people. Again they ask who the woman behind the beautiful girl. Again the girl answers that her mother is her servant. She always says that her mother is her servant every time they meet people.

At last, the mother cannot hold the pain anymore. She prays to God to punish her daughter. God answers her prayer. Slowly, the girl&#39;s leg turns into stone. The process continues to the upper part of the girl&#39;s body. The girl is very panicky.

&quot;Mother, please forgive me!&quot; she cries and ask her mother to forgive her.

But it&#39;s too late. Her whole body finally becomes a big stone. Until now people still can see tears falling down the stone. People then call it the crying stone or batu menangis. </tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="218" name="A Farmer and a Hedgehog Statue" tags="" position="1170,586">IT was a very hot day. A farmer was working on his field. He was there for several hours. He was very tired and wanted to get some rest. Just before he found a nice place to rest, he saw something very shiny.

He came to the shiny object and took it. It was a hedgehog statue. It was very beautiful. Its eyes were made of diamond. Those were the shiny objects he saw. The farmer then brought the statue home. He wanted to show it to his wife. His wife was so happy. They were so poor and planned to sell the statue.

At night, the farmer had a dream. A giant hedgehog came to him.

He said, “Please let me stay in your home. As a return, I will give you everything you want. Just caress the statue’s head and say the prayer. There are two kinds of prayers, one is to start your wish and the second is to stop your wish. Now memorize the prayers.”

The farmer told his wife about his dream. They really wanted to prove it. The farmer slowly caressed the statue&#39;s head. He said the prayer and asked for rice. Suddenly, a magical thing happened. Rice came out of the mouth of the statue. The rice kept on coming out from the statue&#39;s mouth.

The farmer immediately said the prayer to stop it. It worked! The rice then stopped coming out from the statue&#39;s mouth. Now the farmer mentioned other things, they were jewelry and other stuffs they needed. In just a moment, the farmer and his wife became very rich.

They then shared their materials with the neighbors. There was one neighbor who was very jealous. He was actually a thief! He wanted to know how the poor farmers became rich. After the thief found out, he stole the magic hedgehog statue.

He immediately took it and ran away. He was very tired from running and was very thirsty. He wanted to get some water from the statue. He said the prayer. His wish came true. Water came out of the statue’s mouth.

The thief was so happy. He drank and drank the water. He wanted to stop drinking but he did not know how to stop the water. He forgot how to stop the prayer request. Water kept on coming out. He did not know what to do. He was really panicking. He asked for help. People who saw the incident were really scared. They ran away to avoid the water. More and more water surrounded him.

Slowly, it became a small pond. Water flowed on the ground. It became a river. People then named the river as Hedgehog River or Sungai Landak. </tw-passagedata>

&quot;Mom, can I play outside?&quot;

&quot;OK. But don&#39;t play near the river. A crocodile lives there. He will eat you if he is hungry,&quot; says mother cow.

The calf then goes outside. He doesn&#39;t realize now he is near the river.

Suddenly he hears an animal asking for help. He sees a crocodile pinned down a big trunk of a tree. He cannot move. He asks the calf to remove the trunk.

&quot;Help me. It really hurts me. Please remove the trunk,&quot; the crocodile is crying.

The calf then removes the trunk. After the crocodile is free, suddenly he bites the calf&#39;s leg.

&quot;Hey, what are you doing Mr. Crocodile?&quot; the calf is very shocked.

Thanks for your help, now you have to help me becoming my lunch. I&#39;m really hungry,&quot; says the crocodile.

He is still biting the calf&#39;s leg.

The calf is very sad, now he remembers his mother advice, not to play around the river. Suddenly, a monkey passes by. He asked what happens to them.

&quot;The crocodile is bad to me. I already helped him but now, he wants to eat me,&quot; explain the calf to the monkey.

&quot;Is it true? Well I cannot say if the crocodile is bad or not. I didn&#39;t see the accident. Now can you repeat your help?&quot; asked the monkey.

He has a plan to help the calf.

The crocodile then opens his mouth. The calf and the monkey put the big trunk of the tree to crocodile&#39;s body.

And then the monkey whispers to the calf, &quot;Now run! That stupid crocodile cannot eat you!&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Mr. Monkey. You are very clever. I always remember your help!&quot;

The calf then runs as fast as he can. And the crocodile regrets his stupidity. </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="221" name="Mandangin" tags="" position="1778,56">ONCE upon a time, there were a husband and a wife. The husband&#39;s name was Sangkajang and the wife&#39;s name was Nyai Rangkas. It was not easy for them to get married. Nyai Rangkas was not a human. She was a goddess. She loved Sangkajang very much. She was willing to leave the heaven and lived on earth with her husband. The couple had been married for a long time and they did not have any children yet. Nyai Rangkas really wanted to have her own children. And in one night she had a dream. She was meditating on a big stone near the river. After she finished meditating, she would be pregnant.

Nyai Rangkas was sure that the dream was the guidance for her to have her own children. She told her husband about her dream and asked his permission to meditate. Her husband did not agree. It was not a safe place. There were lots of wild animals there. However Nyai Rangkas had already made up her mind. So when her husband was sleeping, she secretly left.

She went to the river to find the big stone. She found it! She immediately sat on it and began her meditation. Meanwhile, Sangkajang woke up in the morning and did not find his wife next to him. He was looking for her but he could not find her. Then he remembered about her wife&#39;s dream. He was sure that his wife was meditating on a big stone near the river.

He went to the river. Suddenly some wild wolves stopped him. The wolves were grinning, showing their sharp teeth just a minute the wolves attacked Sangkajang. He ran fast but sadly the wolves ran faster. They jumped and attacked him. Sangkajang died instantly.

In the meantime, Nyai Rangkas was meditating. Then she heard a voice telling her that she would be pregnant soon. She was asked to take care of the baby very well, because he would be a great man someday.

It was the voice of the God of Wind. Nyai Rangkas was very happy. She finished meditating and went home. However she could not find her husband. She was looking for him everywhere. She kept on calling her husband&#39;s name. Then she found some blood on the ground. She followed the blood trail and she was shocked! She found her husband lying on the ground. He was dead.

Nyai Rangkas was crying terribly. She felt so sorry. But it was too late. After she buried her husband&#39;s body, she continued walking. Nyai Rangkas was completely clueless. She did not know where to go. She was lost. Nyai Rangkas arrived at a cave. She wanted to stay inside the cave. And when she was inside the cave, she met an old woman. Nyai Rangkas asked her permission to stay in the cave.

The old woman gave her permission. She felt very sorry after she heard that Nyai Rangkas just lost her husband. Time passed by and Nyai Rangkas still lived in the cave with the old woman. And finally a baby boy was born. Nyai Rangkas was extremely happy. She named him Mandangin.

Mandangin grew as a good son. He loved his mother very much. He always helped her. And when he was adult, he told his mother that he wanted to wander. His mother knew he could not stop his son&#39;s wish. She remembered the God of Wind&#39;s voice when she meditated that her son would be a great man.

Mandangin arrived in a village. Some people tried to rob him. They were thieves! Mandangin fought them bravely! And, remember, Mandangin was not an ordinary man. His mother was a goddess. So he was a half human and a half god. He possessed the half power that gods had. And it was easy for him to beat those thieves.

The people were happy. They had been living in danger because those thieves always ruined their lives. The villagers asked Mandangin to stay. And because the villagers had no a leader they asked him to be their leader. Mandangin agreed. And later he just did not become the head of the village. He became a king!</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="222" name="The Legend of Malawen Lake" tags="" position="1903,56">ONCE upon a time there was a husband and wife who lived near the jungle. They were very poor. They did not have any children yet. Every day they prayed to god to give them a child. One night the wife had a dream. An old man came to her and told her that she and her husband had to meditate for 100 days in the jungle. The wife told her husband about her dream. They hoped it was a sign from god to give them a child.

Later they went to the jungle. After spending for 100 days, they went home. And it was true! Not long after that the wife was pregnant. And nine months later the baby boy was born. They named him Kumbang Banaung.

Kumbang grew as a handsome and strong young man. However he was not obedient. He never listened to his parents&#39; advice. And it happened again when he wanted to hunt in the jungle. 

It was already dark and his parents asked him to wait until morning. But Kumbang ignored it. He insisted to go to the jungle to hunt.

His parents could not do anything. His father gave Kumbang a magic plate. The plate could help him in a difficult situation. After he received the plate, Kumbang went to the jungle.

It was dark and Kumbang could not see clearly. And he had to face the worst risk. He was lost! He kept on walking and finally he crossed the jungle. He arrived in a village. there was a party. Kumbang saw a very beautiful girl. He came to her and introduced himself.

The girl&#39;s name was Intan. her father was the head of the village. The party was her birthday party. Kumbang fell in love with her. And after the party was over, everybody went home. Kumbang also wanted to go home. He tried to memorized the way to go home. He was lucky. He could go back home. He arrived in the morning. His parents were so worried. Kumbang did not tell them about his experience. He planned to visit Intan again. And after his parents slept, he left the house.

Kumbang met Intan again. She was happy to see Kumbang. She also loved him. They continued to see each other in the following nights. And it made the villagers restless.

They did not like to see what Kumbang and Intan were doing every night. The villagers told the head of the village to do something. Intan&#39;s father had an idea. He came to a rich merchant and asked him to marry his son with Intan. The merchant agreed.

The head of the village told Intan that she would get married soon. Intan was so sad. She told Kumbang to propose her soon. Kumbang immediately told his parents. However they did not agree. They were poor and they thought it was not appropriate for him to propose a rich girl. Kumbang was so angry. He left the house. And he also brought the magic plate.

When he met Intan, Kumbang asked her to run away. And while they were leaving the village, some villagers saw them. They tried to stop the couple. Kumbang and Intan were running. They kept on running and finally they were at the side of a river. They had to cross the river but there was no sampan. Kumbang then remembered about his magic plate. He threw the magic plate to the river.

Amazingly, the plate grew bigger. He asked Intan to get on the plate. They used it as a sampan. While they were crossing the river, suddenly rain fell down heavily. There was a big storm. Heavy wind blew them upside down and finally they were drowning.

Slowly the river changed into a lake. People named the lake as Malawen Lake. People also believed that Kumbang and Intan changed as white crocodiles. They stayed in the lake. Up to now people still believe that the white crocodiles still live in the lake. </tw-passagedata>

One day Jangga and his dog went hunting as usual. He was looking for the animals. However, he could not find any of them. Sadly, he was lost. He could not find a way to his home. While he was walking, suddenly he saw an old woman.

Jangga followed the old woman. She arrived at her house. jangga wanted to stay the night at her house. He knocked the door. an old man opened the door. Jangga told him that he wanted to stay. The old man gave him the permission.

Jangga still enjoyed hunting. With his dog, he often went hunting in the jungle. His wife often told him not to go hunting too long. However, Jangga ignored her.

Jangga&#39;s wife was pregnant. She often asked Jangga to stay at home and not to go hunting. Again, Jangga ignored her. Her wife was often angry with him.

In the morning, Jangga wanted to go hunting. This time his wife was really angry.

&quot;Please stay. Don&#39;t go! I feel like I&#39;m going to deliver the baby today.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. If the baby is a boy, name him Jangga Batuen Bulan. It means Jangga, a man from the moon. And if the baby is a girl, name her Hendan Bawi Bulan. It means Hendan, a woman from the moon,&quot; said Jangga.

Then he left his wife. Not long after that Jangga&#39;s wife delivered a baby boy. She was so angry that her husband was not next to her. She did not want her husband to see the baby.

Later Jnagga came home. He heard a baby was crying. He was so happy.

&quot;Where is the baby? I want to see my baby,&quot; said Jangga.

&quot;No, you can&#39;t! I don&#39;t want you to see the baby!&quot; said Jangga&#39;s wife.

Jangga was so sad. Ans he was also very angry! He went outside of his home. His dog followed him. After that he prayed. He called out his mother.

Suddenly thunder attacked the place. Dark cloud covered him and his dog. Surprisingly, Jangga and his dog disappeared. Not long after that the baby was dead. Jangga brough the baby spirit to the moon.

Jangga&#39;s wife was so sad. She called out Jangga&#39;s name. But it was to late. Jangga and the baby now lived on the moon. Jangga&#39;s wife was crying. She never stop crying.

The Gods heard how she cried and they didn&#39;t like it. The were upset with her and changed her into a bird. People named the bird as pungguk bird.

Until now, during full moon we still can hear the sound of pungguk bird. And we can also see the image of a dog in the moon. From the legend, people make a proverb. It says, &quot;Just like a pungguk waiting for the moon&quot;. It means that it&#39;s just waiting in vain.</tw-passagedata>

In the palace, there were some ladies-in-waiting. There was one lady-in-waiting who was really jealous with the princess. She hated when people talked about the beauty of the princess.

The lady-in-waiting wanted the princess to leave the palace! She had a bad plan. She spread bad rumor about the princess. She told the king that the princess was arrogant to people. She also told him that the princess behaved badly. To make it worse, the lady-in-waiting also told the people that the princess would do something bad to the king. The people loved their king and they hated that news.

Slowly, people hated the princess and sadly the king also believed what the lady-in-waiting said. The king could not control his emotions any longer. He asked the princess to leave the palace!

The princess was crying. She could not understand why his father and the people hated her so much. The princess walked and walked. She did not know where to go. She was lost in the jungle. While she was looking for a place to iest, she met a witch. She also heard about the princess&#39; bad behavior. The&#39;witch cursed the princess into a bird!

&#39;You can become a human again if you find a man who truly loves you,&quot; said the witch.

The princess was helpless. She never thought that her life would be this miserable. She immediately flew away and left the witch.

The princess was hungry. She saw some food on the branch of a lree. She perched on the branch started to eat.

When she enjoyed eating the.food, suddenly a birdcage dropped. She was locked inside the birdcage. She was asking for help but no one heard her. The princess was so tired and weak. She fell asleep.

&quot;Yes, I can. I&#39;m not a real bird..My name is Princess Intan. A witch cursed me into a bird.&quot;

Dohong could not believe what she said.

He asked, &quot;If you are really Princess Intan, why are you in the jungle?&quot;

The princess explained all the incidents to Dohong. She told him that her father hated her. Dohong was so touched to hear the princess&#39; bad experience. He opened the cage and let bird fly. However, the princess did not leave the man. She asked him to show her the way to the palace.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I will take you to the palace. I also heard bad news about you. But unlike others, I don&#39;t believe that rumor. I&#39;m sure you are not as bad as they said. In.fact, you are very kind to people. And honestly, I fell in love with you,&quot; said Dohong.

The princess was smiling. She just found a man who loved her. Slowly, the princess started to change back as a human again:

Dohong was speechless. The bird he caught had just turned into a beauti-fi.rl woman. She was indeed the beautiful Princess Intan! Together with Dohong, the princess went to the palace. They met the king and explained everything.

<tw-passagedata pid="225" name="Ambun and Rimbun" tags="" position="1653,183">AMBUN and Rimbun were brothers. People always thought they were twins, they both looked alike. Actually, Ambun was one year older than Rimbun.

The two brothers lived with their mother in a hut. Their father had died when they were kids. They always helped their mother finding some firewood and then sold them at the market.

They were poor and Ambun was upset with his condition. He wanted to go to some place and worked. He hoped he could get lots of money and give it to his mother.

He talked to his mother about his plan. His mother could not stop him. However, Rimbun also wanted to join his older brother. Apparently he also had the same feeling about their poor life. The mother could not do anything. She knew how good they were. She also knew that they just wanted to make her happy.

Before they left, the mother gave them two traditional knives, one was wrapped by red cloth and the other one was wrapped by yellow cloth. Ambun got the red one, while Rimbun got the yellow one.

The two brothers started their journey. When they crossed a jungle, suddenly Rimbun fell down. Ambun was so panicky.

&quot;What happened? Are you all right?&quot;

Rimbun didn&#39;t say anything. He looked very pale. Ambun brought him to sit under a big tree. Rimbun suffered a strange illness. His physical condition was getting weaker. And finally, Rimbun died.

Ambun was extremely sad. He felt guilty. He thought that he should not have let his brother join him. Ambun then buried his brother. He took his brother&#39;s knife and stabbed in on his grave.

Ambun continued his iourney in the jungle. It was getting dark and he d.id not have a place to stay. From a distance, he saw a house. He knocked the door, not long after that an old woman greeted him. i{.mbun asked her permission to stay in her house. Luckily she welcomed him to stay.

Ambun introduced himself to her and told her about his mother and his brother, who was just dead in the jungle. He also told her that he wanted to work so he could have lots of  money. He wanted to make his mother happy.

The old woman was amazed to hear how Ambun wanted to make his mother happy. She then told him great information.

&quot;I heard that the king is looking for a man to marry his daughter. Later he will also ask the man to be the next king to replace him. But there is one condition. The man has to be able to jump from the front yard of the palace to the roof of the palace to pick a jasmine flower.&quot;

Ambun wqnted to participate. He thought he could do it. When his father was alive, he had taught his sons about some skills.

Ambun and the old woman arrived at the palace. People mockedAmbun. Previously, some princes from other kingdoms had tried and they all failed. They thought how a poor man like Ambun could win the competition.

Fortunately, the king let him try. Ambun concentrated. He was thinking of his father. Then.. wusshhhh. He could easily jump and pick the jasinine.&#39;People were astonishedl They applaudetlapd eheered,Iimbun. The king was also happy. He finally found the winner.

Before the wedding started, Ambun went home. He wanted to ask his mother to stay in the palace. However, she was extremely sad when she knew Rimbun was dead. She asked Ambun to find &#39;the water of life&#39; in the top of the mountain.

After he got the water, the mother asked Ambun to dig Rimbun&#39;s grave. She poured the water into Ambun&#39;s dead body. Amazingly, Rimbun was backto life. The family was reunited. Ambun got married and later he became the king. He also asked the old woman to stay in the palace. Since then they all lived happily ever after. </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="226" name="The Salty River" tags="" position="1778,183">A long time ago in Sepang Village, Central Kalimantan, lived a widow named Emas. Her husband died when her daughter was a baby. Her daughter’s name was Tumbai. The villagers in Sepang Village were poor.

Though they were poor, the villagers always worked hard. Fortunately there was a well in the village. So they always had enough water to live.

Tumbai was a very good daughter. She was diligent and obedient. She always helped her mother and listened to her mother’s advice. She also liked to help other people. That was why everybody knew her.

Tumbai was not only famous for her kindness, but she was also famous for her beauty. She was very beautiful! Many young men fell in love with her. One by one, they proposed her to be their wife. However, Tumbai always refused the marriage proposal. She was confused. So she prayed to God to give her guidance.

Finally she got the answer. In her dream, an old man asked her to marry a man who could change the well from fresh water into salt water. When she woke up, Tumbai was very confused.

She thought it was difficult for a man to change the fresh water into salt water. Fresh water did not have any taste. It was different from sea water which is salty.

When Tumbai told her mother about her dream, her mother was also confused. However, she knew that her daughter was very good and wouldn&#39;t lie to her. Her mother had a feeling, probably God was going to help them from poverty.

Her mother then made an announcement that Tumbai would marry a man who could change the fresh water in the well into salt water. Everybody was laughing. They thought Tumbai and her mother were crazy.

But it did not stop those young men to try. They really wanted to marry Tumbai. So they all tried to change the fresh water into salt water. But they all failed.

One day a man came. He lived in the riverside of Barito River. He had supernatural power.

“Ma’am, I’m here to marry your daughter,” said the man to Emas, Tumbai’s mother.

“Do you know the test?” asked Emas.

“I do. I will change the fresh water into salt water,” said the man.

The man then sat down next to the well. He was meditating and prayed to God. All the villagers were circling the man. They all were curious.

After a while, the man finished meditating. He stood up and asked the villagers to taste the water from the well.

It worked! He succeeded in changing the water. Tumbai was happy. She fi nally found her dream husband.

And her mother was right. After the water was salty, the villagers were not poor anymore. They changed the salty water into salt. They sold it and they had money.

The salty water was flowing from the well to the Kahayan River. Until now people still taste the salty water in Kahayan River. They also think that the legend really happened.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="227" name="The Legend of Nusa Island" tags="" position="1903,183">A long time ago there was a man named Nusa, he was a farmer. He lived with his wife and his brother. Nusa and his brother were very diligent farmers.

Nusa and other farmers in the village were sad because the rain had not fallen for a very long time. Their rice fields were dried. They needed water.

Nusa then decided to ask his family to move to another place. After walking for three days, they finally arrived in a new place. It was very fertile. They had a lot of water because there was a river there.

After they arrived, Nusa looked for something to eat. Later he brought a very big egg. He asked his wife to cook the egg.

After it was cooked, he asked his wife and his brother to eat the egg. However, they refused to eat. They were not sure with the egg. It was very big, Nusa did not care because he was so hungry. After he ate, then he slept.

In the morning Nusa screamed in pain. His wife and brother immediately came to him. They were surprised to see what happened to Nusa. His body was full of scales. His legs changed into a tail. His body was getting bigger.

“What happened to me?”, He said.

“Was it because of the egg I ate last night? Oh my God! Maybe it’s a dragon’s egg. Now I have changed into a dragon.”

Nusa then asked his wife and brother to move him to the river. He could not walk and move his body on the land. Slowly they tried to pull Nusa’s body. Finally they succeeded.

“Please forgive me, I cannot live with you anymore. I will live in this river, go home and tell people about me. Ask them to be careful with what they eat” said Nusa. Later Nusa disappeared into the river.

Nusa had completely changed into a dragon. He ate fish. All the fish were scared.

Nusa ate a lot of fish. The fish had to do something. They had to stop Nusa from eating them. They then held a meeting.

“I have an idea,” said a small fish. “Just be prepared to attack the dragon when I give you all the sign.”

The small fish then came to Nusa. He said, “Master, there is another dragon live in the river. The dragon is bigger and more powerful than you are. He challenges you to fight”, said the small fish to Nusa.

“Oh yeah, Hmmm I’m the biggest dragon and the most powerful dragon. I will fight him!” said Nusa.

In days and nights Nusa was preparing the fight. He was always thinking about his enemy. He could not sleep. He was very tired. When Nusa was sleepy, the small fi sh screamed.

“Master! Your enemy was behind you!”

Nusa turned his big body very fast. His tail was still in front of him. He thought his tail was his enemy. He attacked and bit his own tail and he screamed.

Suddenly the small fish said, “Attack!”

Than all the fish attacked Nusa.

They all bit Nusa’s body. Nusa tried to save his life. He swam to the river side. But it was too late. He was very weak. Finally he died.

His body slowly changed into an island. People then named the island as Nusa Island. It’s located at Kahayan River, Central Kalimantan. </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="228" name="The Curse of King Mintin" tags="" position="2028,183">A long time ago in Kahayan Hilir, Central Kalimantan, there was an island named Mintin. The people in the island lived peacefully. The king of the island, King Mintin, was wise. He loved his people very much.

However, soon the happiness was ended. The kingdom was mourning. The queen just passed away. The king was sad and decided to leave the palace and went to another island. He asked his twin sons, Naga and Buaya, to lead the kingdom while he was away.

At first, Naga and Buaya led the kingdom wisely. They did their father’s advice to them. Unfortunately, it did not last long.

Naga and Buaya had different personalities. Naga was ignorant to the people and loved parties, while Buaya was very caring and loving to the people. Buaya then asked Naga to stop his bad habits.

Naga was angry. He asked Buaya not to disturb him. Buaya was also angry. He reminded Naga about their father’s advice

“Father is not here! And you are not my father, why do I have listen to you?” said Naga.

Both of them were angry and could not control themselves. They were fighting. The fighting was getting bigger and it changed into a civil war. It was because the soldiers were involved. The soldiers were divided into two parts.

Some of them supported Naga and the other soldiers supported Buaya. The people of Mintin Island were suffering great pain. Because of the war, they could not live peacefully. Some of them were very hungry and suffered from illnesses. Mintin Island was in chaos!

The king finally heard the war. He decided to go back to Mintin Island. When he arrived, he immediately asked his twin sons to stop the war. The king was really angry.

“I’m very disappointed with you, sons. I trusted you to take care of this kingdom. But you have failed. I don’t care who is right or wrong. Both of you will be punished!” said the king. He then continued.

“Buaya, I know you are a good son. You are wise and love the people. But you cannot control your emotions. Buaya, you have fewer mistakes than Naga. But I still have to punish you. I curse you into a crocodile. You can stay here in Mintin Island and your job is to take care of the people,” said the king.

He then talked to Naga. “You have more mistakes. So, the punishment is bigger. I curse you into a dragon. You are not allowed to stay here. Go away and live in other place!” asked the king.

Right after the king finished his last words, heavy storm attacked Mintin Island. Buaya and Naga slowly changed. Buaya became a crocodile and Naga became a dragon. </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="229" name="Sangi the Hunter" tags="" position="2155,183">A long time ago in Central Kalimantan, a great hunter named Sangi lived. Every time he went to the jungle to go hunting, he brought a lot of animals home. Sangi lived with his family on a riverside.

As always, Sangi went to the jungle. He saw some footprints of a wild hog. He slowly followed the footprints. The footprints ended in a big tree. Sangi thought the hog was behind the tree. Slowly he walked around the tree then he was really amazed. He saw a big dragon was trying to swallow a wild hog. The hog was so big that the dragon could not swallow it easily.

After several times trying to swallow, finally the dragon gave up. Suddenly, the dragon looked at Sangi. He was really shocked! He wanted to run very fast. He thought the dragon would eat him alive.

Though Sangi had tried to run, his feet could not move at all. The dragon slowly came to him. Then they were face to face. When the dragon was exactly in front of him, it turned into smoke. When the smoke was gone, there was a handsome man.

He said, &#39;&#39;Eat that wild hog. This is your punishment for seeing me try to eat.&#39;&#39;

&#39;&#39;I can&#39;t. I am a human. I cannot eat a wild hog that big,&#39;&#39; said Sangi.

&#39;&#39;Yes, you can. If you are a dragon, you can eat that hog,&#39;&#39; said the man.

Then Sangi changed into a dragon. After that, he ate the hog. Later, he changed back as a human.

&#39;&#39;What happened to me? Why could I change as a dragon?&#39;&#39; said Sangi.

&#39;&#39;It also happened to me years ago. I did what you did. I saw a dragon ate then the dragon made me a dragon. It is great to be like us. We are half dragon and half human. You can change to be a dragon or human anytime you like. Besides that, you can be forever young. I&#39;m more than 100 years old but I still look young right?&#39;&#39; said the man.

He continued, &#39;&#39;There is one condition that you have to do. Don&#39;t tell anyone that you are a half dragon and half human. If you did, you could be a dragon forever and unable to change back as human,&#39;&#39; said the man. After that, he disappeared.

Since then, Sangi had two lives, one as a dragon and one as a human. He also looked young although he was really old. People always asked the secret, but he never told them why he could look young forever.

On his 150th birthday, people could not stand it anymore. More and more people asked him. Sangi gave up. He told them that he was actually a half dragon and half human. People were laughing at him. They did not believe that.

&#39;&#39;I am a dragon!&#39;&#39; screamed Sangi. He was upset because they did not believe him.

Right after Sangi finished saying that, his body was shaking. Slowly he changed as a dragon. People were scared. They were running away.

Sangi was really sad. He regretted for telling them his secret. He knew he could not live in the village with his family anymore. He went to the river and lived there. Since then, people named the river Sangi River. </tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="231" name="A Buffalo and a Monkey" tags="" position="2168,58">IT was a very hot day. A monkey was walking by the riverside. He was very thirsty and hungry. He took some water and drank it. He was very happy.

Then, he saw some banana trees. But they were across the river. The monkey could not swim so he was thinking very hard.

Suddenly, &quot;Aha!&quot; said the monkey.

He had an idea. Not far from him, a buffalo was drinking some water in the river. He came closer to the buffalo and told him his plan.

&quot;Hello, Mr Buffalo. Are you hungry?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I am. I really want to eat some grass,&quot; said the buffalo.

&quot;I know a place where you can eat a lot of grass. It is across the river.&quot;

&quot;I know that place. It&#39;s a field. A farmer owns it. He will be angry if I eat the grass on his field,&quot; said the buffalo.

&quot;You are right. He is angry if he sees you eating the grass. If he does not see you, he won&#39;t be angry, right?&quot; the monkey kept on persuading the buffalo.

&quot;Come on! Let&#39;s go now. We just have to be quiet and do not make noise,&quot; said the monkey.

Actually, he wanted to trick the buffalo. He wanted to sit on the buffalo&#39;s back while they were crossing the river.

&quot;Ok then. But promise you won&#39;t be noisy,&quot; said the buffalo.

The monkey immediately jumped on the buffalo&#39;s back. The buffalo&#39;s body was big. He did not have problem in crossing the river. After a while, they arrived at the farmer&#39;s field. Both of them immediately ate.

&quot;Mr Buffalo, I&#39;m already full. Let&#39;s go back,&quot; said the monkey.

&quot;But I&#39;m not full yet. Wait for a moment.&quot;

The monkey was impatient. He was thinking how he could ask the buffalo to go back across the river. Then he had an idea. He made a lot of noise. It was very loud! The farmer heard the noise and he approached them.

When he saw two animals were eating on his field, the farmer threw some stones. One big stone hit the buffalo&#39;s head. The buffalo&#39;s cried in pain. He immediately ran to the river. The monkey followed him and jumped on the buffalo&#39;s back.

&quot;Why did you make a lot of noise? You promised to keep quiet!&quot; said the buffalo while they were crossing the river.

&quot;Now, I want to take a bath here. I want to clean up my wound.&quot;

&quot;But I cannot swim. If you take a bath here, I will be drawn,&quot; the monkey was panic.

&quot;I don&#39;t care. You made me bleed.&quot; The buffalo then rolled over his body.

The monkey had to hold very tight. He was very scared. After the buffalo finished taking a bath, then he crossed back to the riverside. The monkey was very wet. He was very weak and frightened. He apologized to the buffalo. And he promised not to do it again.</tw-passagedata>

“What do you have for the bait?”

“Some worms,” answered Uder.

Then he continued walking. Then he met another neighbor. Again, the neighbor asked where Uder was going and what he had for the bait. Uder answered.

After that, he met another neighbor. He also asked the same question. Uder was tired of answering. He was upset. So he decided to ignore everyone.

While he was walking very fast, he met a group of monkeys. They could talk like humans.

“Hey Uder, are you going fishing?” asked one of the monkeys.

“Yes, I am.”

“What do you have for the bait?”

Uder was still upset with all those same questions. This time he could not take it anymore.

“I’m going to use your mother for the bait!” said Uder.

“Hey! Don’t make fun with my mother!” Those monkeys were angry.

They took Uder. Then they tied him in a big tree.

“Please forgive me. I did not mean to make fun with your mother. I was just upset with all those questions my neighbors had asked me.” explained Uder.

“Okay, we forgive you. We will free you, if you can tell us a place where we can eat fruits. We are hungry.”

Some of the visitors have unique reasons. They want to have spouses. Some people believe that taking a bath with the water from the pond will lead them to their spouses. There is a legend behind the belief. Do you want to know the story? Read on!

A long time ago in South Kalimantan there was a village. The land was fertile. Trees grew well there. people and animals had enough water to live. They had a great source of water. They got the water from a pond. People used the water not only for their daily activities but also for watering their plants. The villagers were never worried about lacking of water.

The head of the village was Awang Sukma. He always protected his people very well. People from other places often visited the village to get some water. Awang Sukma always treated them very well. Awang Sukma was single. He was looking for a wife.

One night, Awang Sukma was going to the pond. From a distance, he heard some people were taking a bath in the pond. He was curious. He approached the pond carefully. He was so surprised when he saw seven beautiful girls having fun in the pond. They were swimming and laughing.

Who were they? Well, they were angels from the heaven. Awang Sukma was so amazed with their beauty. He slowly walked closer and took one of the girls&#39; clothes.

After they finished, the girls wore their cloths. However, one girl looked so sad. Her name was putri Bungsu. She was looking for her cloth. Other girls helped to find the missing cloth but they could not find it. It was almost morning and the angels had to fly back to the heaven. They had to leave her.

While Putri Bungsu was crying, Awang Sukma approached her.

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid. You can come to my house now.&quot;

Putri Bungsu agreed to stay in Awang Sukma&#39;s house. Awang Sukma fell in love with her. He proposed her and later they got married. They lived happily. And they were happier when they a got baby girl. They named her Kumalasari.

Putri Bungsu opened the lid and she found her cloth inside the barrel! She was so happy but also angry and sad. She was happy because she could go back to heaven.

However she was angry at Awang Sukma for hiding her cloth. And she was sad because she had to say good bye to her daughter.

&quot;I don&#39;t belong here. My place is in the heaven,&quot; said Putri Bungsu to Awang Sukma.

Then Putri Bungsu flew to the heaven leaving Awang Sukma and Kumalasari. Awang Sukma was so sad. He just lost his lovely wife. He cried.

Awang Sukma then told his daughter not to keep black cock as a pet. He believed that black cock brought them bad luck.

It was not only Awang Sukma who was sad losing Putri Bungsu. All the villagers were also sad. And later they named the pond as Telaga Bidadari, it means the Angel pond. Until now people believe that taking a bath using the water from the pond would lead to their spouses. And the local people do not keep black cock.

Recently, their lives were disturbed by the dutch. At first they came in peace. They wanted to do some business with the local people. The area was fertile. All kinds of trees grew very well. And the Dutch were interested in buying the harvest. The business ran well.

However slowly the Dutch tried to cheat the business, they wanted to steal and occupy the area. They wanted to have all the harvest!

Luckily, the Dutch&#39;s plan to occupy the place was stopped by Datu Kalaka. He used all his power to make sure that the Dutch would not set their feet in their place.

The Dutch knew that Datu Kalaka lived in the village. But they were never able to find him. Why? It was because Datu Kalaka was always hiding and moving from one place to another place. And the villagers always let him hide in their houses. They helped him because Datu Kalaka also helped the villagers.

The Dutch had lost their patience against Datu Kalaka. And they came to the village with a full force. They came with lots of soldiers equipped with their guns! They came to the village and asked the villagers about Datu Kalaka. And when the villagers said they did not know where he was, the Dutch hit them!

&quot;Hey, look! It&#39;s Datu Kalaka!! Get him now!&quot; said one soldier.

Datu Kalaka ran very fast. He did not want to fight in the village. He was afraid that the villagers would become the victims.

&quot;Hey stop! Or we&#39;ll shoot you!&quot; said the Commander.

&quot;Ha ha ha... catch me if you can!&quot; said Datu Kalaka.

He ran very fast and the Dutch followed him. They did not want to lose him. They knew how dangerous he was. And that was why they brought guns! They were ordered to catch Datu Kalaka dead or alive.

Datu Kalaka was cornered. All the Dutch were everywhere.

&quot;Ha ha ha... We will catch you now. You cannot go anywhere else,&quot; said one soldier.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to give up!&quot; said Datu Kalaka.

He climbed a big tree and later jumped from that tree. The soldiers chased him. They saw the direction where Datu Kalaka jumped. And when they arrived they did not see anyone. Instead they found a swing.

When they approached the swing they found a baby inside the swing. But the baby was different from any other babies. The baby was so big. It was a giant a baby! The soldiers were scared.

&quot;Hey look! The baby is so big. If the baby is big like this one, how about the parents? They must be giants! &quot;

They did not know that Datu Kalaka had changed himself into a giant baby. The soldiers ran away and they did not come back to the village.

When Datu Kalaka was dead, he was buried in the village. The village was then named as Kalaka village. Until now, the tomb is still in Kalaka South Kalimantan. The grave is so big. The local people believe that Datu Kalaka is buried there.</tw-passagedata>

He was kind and very helpful. His father died when he was a baby. Though he was very young, he behaved like an adult. He knew he had to help his mother to earn a living. And that made his mother loved him very much.

A rich merchant was passing Angui&#39;s house. He stopped and paid attention to the kid. He liked Angui very much. He asked some people about Angui. And when he knew that Angui came from a poor family, he wanted to adopt Angui.

The rich merchant came to Angui&#39;s house. He talked to Nini Kudampai. He told him that he wanted to adopt Angui. He promised that he would let Angui go home and live with her after Angui  was an adult. And he also promised that he would give Angui a good education.

Nini Kudampai was so touched. She was in a big dilemma. She was happy that her only son would get a good education, however she was also sad that she would not see son anymore. She agreed with the merchant&#39;s plan. She let him adopt her soon.

With a big ship, the merchant and Angui sailed to the city. He raised Angui very well. He sent Angui to the best school. And he also taught him how doing business. Angui was smart. He could understand everything very fast. The merchant was very happy. He slowly gave some of his business to Angui. And Angui paid the trust by giving the merchant a lot of profit.

Angui was adult, the rich merchant planned to give all his business to Angui. However the rich merchant asked Angui to get married before he could receive the entire merchant&#39;s business. And Angui agreed.

Angui and his wife were very happy. Also, they were very rich. The merchant remembered his promise to Nini Kudampai. He told Angui to go home. But Angui refused. The merchant then reminded Angui about his promised. His wife also asked Angui to go to his hometown. Angui gave up. He asked his crew to prepare his ship. They would sail to Tapin.

The news spread very fast. People were talking that Angui would go back home. His mother finally heard the news also. She brought  Angui&#39;s pets, the white pig, the white dog, and the white cock.

Nini Kudampai was standing at the harbor. When she saw Angui, she called out his name. Angui saw his mother. She looked very old and shabby. He was ashamed. His wife asked him who the old woman was, but he said that he did not know her. He then asked his crew to continue sailing. The ship did not stop.

Nini Kudampai was so sad, and she was also very angry. She cursed Angui for ignoring her. She had been waiting for her son to come back. And when he arrived, he ignored and did not want to admit her as his mother.

God heard the old woman&#39;s praying. Suddenly the rain fell down heavily. Thunder attacked the ship. It turned upside down! The ship finally stranded. Slowly the ship changed into a big stone. Later, the big stone slowly changed into a cave. People then named the cave as Batu Hapu Cave.</tw-passagedata>

The merchant smiled. &quot;No, I don&#39;t. I came here because I want to ask you to join me in rny ship. I;m a.merchant ind I need a good employee like you. So, what do you think?&quot;

Angui could not believe what he heard. He did not say yes to the merchant. He wanted to ask his mother&#39;s permission first. The merchant understood. He would come back tomorrow to hear Angui&#39;s decision..

Angui immediately went back home. He told his mother about the merchant&#39;s request.

&quot;It&#39;s a good opportunity, d Mother. If I work for him, I will have lots of money and we can be rich,&quot; said Angui.

The mother knew she could not stop him. She had to let him go. Before leaving, Angui asked his mother to take care ofhis rooster. He loved his rooster, but he could not bring it in the ship.

Soon Angui was in the ship. He worked diligently and very hard. He was also very polite. SlowIy, the merchant gave him more responsibilities. Angui did not want to disappoint. the merchant. He did all the jobs very well. No wonder that Angui became the merchant&#39;s right hand man.

The ship arrived. Angui&#39;s mother called his son&#39;s name. Angui&#39;s wife was curious. 

She asked, &#39;Who&#39;s that old woman calling out your name?&quot;

Angui was ashamed. He did not want to tell the truth. 

He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know who she is. Guard! Ask that old woman to leave! I Don&#39;t let her come here!&quot;

Angui&#39;s mother was so sad. Though , she repeatedly called out his name and told him that she was his mother, Angui ignored her.

Slowly the two parts of the ships became big stones and slowly they became mountains. People later named the mountains as Batu Bini or the stone of wife and Batu Laki or the stone of husband.</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="240" name="Datu Mabrur and the Swordfish" tags="" position="1798,440">DATU Mabrur brought a big stone to the sea. He threw the stone to the sea, jumped, and landed on the stone.

He sat and started to meditate. Who was Datu Mabrur? Well, he was a holy man. He had an amazing supernatural power. He meditated in the sea because he wanted to ask God to give him an island for his descendants. He meditated days and nights.

He ignored the hot sun, the rain, and even the storm. Datu Mabrur did not know that while he was meditating, some swordfish swam surrounding the stone. The fish would attack him!

One swordfish was flying. It attacked Datu Mabrur. Although he meditated solemnly, he knew what happened surrounding him. When the swordfish was about to attack him, he moved his hand and hit the fish back.

The fish was thrown back to the sea. Unfortunately another fish was also ready to attack him. Again, Datu Mabrur hit back and the fish was back to the sea. Later, some swordfish flew and attacked him. This time Datu Mabrur opened his eyes, stood up, and busily defended his life. It repeated several times and finally all the fish gave up.

Datu Mabrur thought the attack would stop. Well, he was wrong. There was one big swordfish was waiting. Unlike any other swordfish this swordfish was different. He was the biggest swordfish. He was also able to talk with humans. He was the king of the swordfish.

&quot;Hey old man! Your meditation is disturbing us! You have made all the fish here restless. You have to leave the sea now!&quot; said the swordfish king.

&quot;Well,l&#39;m sorry if I disturb you. By the way, may I know who you are?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m the king of the swordfish. Your meditation has disturbed the whole kingdom. I will fight you if you don&#39;t want to leave,&quot; said the swordfish king.

&quot;No! I&#39;m not going to leave until I have an island for my descendants.&quot;

&quot;You want an island? That&#39;s easy for me. Let&#39;s make a deal. We will fight. If you lose, you have to leave now. But if I lose, I will give you an island.&quot;

&quot;You can give me an island? How?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s easy for me. I will ask all the swordfish to make an island. How about that? Deal?&#39;

&quot;Deal!&quot; said Datu Mabrur.

Then they were fighting. The swordfish king was flying. He tried to attack Datu Mabrur. But he was ready. He used his supernatural power to fight back. He succeeded! The swordfish was flying helplessly. He lost his balance and thrown back to the sea. He was trying to fly again, but he was too weak. He gave up!

&quot;I surrender. As I promised I will help you make an island.&quot;

The swordfish king swam back to the sea. Later a lot of swordfish dug the land in the bottom of the sea and brought it to the surface. All the fish pushed the land and they all yelled,

&quot;Sa-ijaan! Sa-ijaan ! Sa-ijaan!&quot;

Sa-ijaan means one heart, one mind and one idea. Slowly, a new island was made. Datu Mabrur was really grateful.

He then named the island as Halimun Island which is later also named as The Sea Island or Pulau Laut because it appeared from the bottom of the sea. Now the local people use the image of swordfish and the word Sa-ijaan as the symbol and the slogan of Kotabaru Regency, South Kalimantan.</tw-passagedata>

A long time ago there was an old woman living with his only son. His name was Raden Penganten. They were poor. The only had a small piece of land to cultivate. Sometimes Raden Penganten hunted in the jungle and sold the animal meat.

&quot;But Mother, I want to get married. And I want my family to be happy. I want to have a big house and a lot of money. I want to sail. I promise I will be back home soon and bring you a lot of money,&quot; said Raden Penganten.

The mother was speechless. She could say nothing. She knew her son was stubborn. When he already made up his mind, lt could. not be changed at all.

Sadly, she let her son go. She repeatedly asked him to go back home soon. And Raden Penganten promised. Raden Penganten sailed in a big ship. The cnrise spent days.

After.seeing many people, finally a rich merchant accepted him to work. Raden Penganten was very happy. He worked diligently. He was also smart.

In a very short time, he could learn everything. The merchant was very happy. Since Raden Penganten worked for him, their business grew increasingly. The merchant gave him more trust. Raden Penganten was not just an employee anymore, he was like a manager. He paid the trust by working harder. The merchant was very happy with him. He did not have a son; he only had one beautiful daughter. Sq he planned to ask Raden Penganten to marry his daughter. Raden Penganten agreed. He had been in love with the merchant&#39;s daughter.

Raden.Penganten was thinking about his mother. He wanted to visit her. He. asked his wife to join him. They sailed ina big ship. After cruising for days, they finally arrived.

People were amazed. They were talking about Raden Penganten. The mother finally heard that his only son was finally coming back home. She immediately left the house. When she arrived she sawmany people were looking at the ship. She was trying tio approach the ship. When she daw her son, she called out his name,

&quot;Raden Penganten... Raden Penganten... Welcome home, Son!&quot;

Raden Penganten was shocked to see her mother. She Iooked dirty. Her clothes were shabby. And she also looked very old. Raden Penganten was ashamed to see his mother. He pretended not to see her. He ignored his own mother!

Raden Penganten asked his crews to leave the harbour. They wanted to continue sailing. The mother was very sad. She prayed to God to punish her son. God answered her prayer. Suddenly heavy rain fell down. Storm and thunder attacked the ship. The ship could not maintain its balance. Soon it was broken into pieces.

<tw-passagedata pid="242" name="The Red Dragons versus the White Dragon" tags="" position="2048,433">ONCE upon a time in South Kalimantan, there was a family. The father was a fisherman. He had a wife and a son. His son was still a little boy. The farmer and his wife really
loved him very much.

The fisherman caught the fish in the river. He had a small sampan and a net. Everyday he rowed his sampan along the river. He threw the net and caught the fish.

However, one day he could not catch any fish. He was curious why the fish was gone. He threw his net once again. He felt the net was heavy. He pulled it carefully. When he saw his net, he was
disappointed. He did not catch any fish. Instead, there was a big egg. He threw the egg back to the river. He threw his net again.

Suddenly, he felt the net was heavy. This time he really hoped he caught a lot of fish. Sadly, there was no fish at all. Again, he found a big egg in his net. And he threw the egg back to the river.

Later, he threw the net back to the river. And it happened again. He did not catch any fish, but he caught a big egg. The fisherman gave up. He did not want to go home with empty hands. So he brought the egg home.

When he arrived at home, he told his wife that he could not catch any fish. Instead, he caught a big
egg. He asked his wife to boil the egg. When it was cooked, they both ate the egg.

Meanwhile, their son was sleeping. They did not eat the whole egg. The rest of the egg was still on the plate. Later, the fisherman and his wife went to bed.

In the morning, they both woke up. They felt something very strange with their body. They had red scales all over their bodies. They also had tails. Their bodies grew bigger. The fisherman and
his wife had changed into red dragons.

They were shocked! They ran away from the house and jumped to the river. Tfey swam and they found another dragon. And it was a white dragon.

&quot;Ha ha ha.. You have eaten the egg.And now you have changed into a dragon like me!&quot; said the white dragon.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked the fisherman.

&quot;I hate you. I know you always catch the fish here..The fish is my food too. I want to stop you catching the fish. So I put the egg in your net. The egg is a magic egg. Anyone who eats the egg will change into a dragon&quot; said the white dragon.

The fisherman was angry. He wanted to attack the white dragon. Suddenly he remembered his son. He asked his wife to go back home and told him not to eat the egg.

The fisherman&#39;s wife immediately went home. When she arrived, her son already woke up, He was crying looking for his parents. He was so scared when he saw a dragon at home.

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid, my son. It&#39;s me. I&#39;m your mother. Your father and I have changed into dragons. Please don&#39;t eat the egg on the plate. Otherwise you will change into a dragon too. Right now, your father is fighting against the white dragon. I will follow him. After this, you go to the river. If you see the water in the river changed into white, it means your father and I already kill the white dragon. But if you see the watei is red, it means we are dead,&quot; later she went back to the river.

The boy then went to the river. He was waiting for days. After a while, he saw the &#39;water changed into white. After that, his parents appeared and swam to the river side.

The father said, &quot;My sory we cannot be together again. Your mother and I will stay in the river forever. But don&#39;t worry, we will always guard you.&quot; Then they swam back to the river and
disappeared.

Until now, the people in Kalimantan believe that dragons still live in the rivers. The Dayak people also believe that when a dragon shows up in the river, rain will fall down heavily and it will flood the area.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="243" name="The Greedy King" tags="" position="2173,433">ONCE upon a time there was a kingdom in South Kalimantan. The king was Sang Hiyang. He liked to eat. His favorite food was fish intestine. He often asked the palace chef to provide him fish intestine in a big proportion. The King Sang Hiyang would be angry when the chef only gave him a small proportion. The chef did not have any problem preparing the fish intestine because there was a big river near the palace. She always asked the soldiers to catch the fish.

One day, the chef was restless. The soldiers just gave her a few fish. The soldiers said that it was not a good season to catch the fish. The chef immediately cuts and cleaned the fish from the river. She was thinking about the punishment of the king. She was really worried and she did not concentrate when cutting and cleaning the fish. Accidentally, she dropped the fish intestine to the river. The current was very strong. In just a minute, she lost the entire fish intestine!

The chef was really shocked. She talked to her husband about the problem. He had an idea. He dug the land and collected a lot of worms. He gave the worms to his wife and asked her to cook. At first his wife refused. But the husband convinced her that the worms looked like the fish intestine. The King Sang Hiyang would not recognize the difference.

The chef immediately cooked the worms and prepared it to the king. When it was done, the king ate the worms. He was very happy. He felt that the &#39;fish intestine&#39; was more delicious. He called the chef and asked her to always provide him the delicious fish intestine.

The chef was very worried. She knew sooner or later the king would find out. She did not want to lie. And finally she told the king about the truth. She did not cook fish intestine, instead she cooked worms!

And after King Sang Hiyang knew the truth, he was not angry. He loved to eat the worms. He asked the chef to always prepare the worms in big proportions.

Everyday the soldiers dug the land to find the worms. Soon, the numbers of worms were decreasing. The king of worms was angry. He was sad to see his people were gone. He asked the worm soldiers to attack King Sang Hiyang.

The worm soldiers went to the palace. They finally found King Sang Hiyang. The king was so scared to see a lot of worms came to him. Amazingly,  the King was the only one who could see the worms. Other people could not see the worms. Therefore, they were wondering why the king looked so scared.

The king ran out of the palace. The worms followed him. They slowly chased King Sang Hiyang. The king did not know where to go. He finally found a big tree. He then climbed the tree. Later the worms surrounded the tree. They could not climb the tree. They just waited on the ground. It has happened for many days. And the king was beginning to be frustrated. He just wanted to die. He wanted to commit suicide!

King Sang Hiyang tore his shirt and he made it as a rope. He already made up his mind. He wanted to hang himself! And after it happened, the people were shocked. They saw King Sang Hiyang was hanging.

They said, &quot;Sang Hiyang tergantung! Sang Hiyang tergantung!&quot;

It means Sang Hiyang is hung.

Soon the area of the incident was named Sang Hiyang Tergantung and now it slowly changes into Siang Gantung. It is an area in Sungai Selatan, South Kalimantan. </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="244" name="The Legend of Gunung Bangkai" tags="" position="2175,183">THERE was a woman who lived near the jungle. She lived with her son. Her husband died many years ago. Her son&#39;s name was Andung. He always helped her mother.

Andung was in the jungle to collect some firewood. And while he was walking to go home, he heard someone asking for help. Andung was looking around and he saw an old man was injured. Andung immediately help him. The old man was really grateful. He gave Andung a gift.

&quot;I want you to have this necklace. You have already helped me and this is my gratitude to you. This necklace is great. It can cure all disease,&quot; said the old man.

Andung was really happy. It looked so beautiful. And when he arrived home, he gave it to his mother. She was very happy to receive the necklace.

Andung wanted to have a better life. He wanted to leave his home and had a better job. He told his plan to his mother. At first she did not agree. However, Andung insisted with his plan and his mother could not hold him anymore.

&quot;Before you go, please wear this necklace. I hope you will always remember me.&quot;

Andung had his journey and he finally arrived in a kingdom. When he arrived, he saw an old woman suffered skin rash. Andung really felt sorry. He then remembered the message from the old man who gave him the necklace. He tried to cure the old woman. He put the necklace into a glass of water. he asked the old woman to drink the water. Amazingly, the old woman was cured. She told everyone that Andung cured her.

The news spread very fast. Many sick people came to Andung. They all were cured. And the news about Andung was heard by the king.

The princess was ill. The king had already asked many healers to cure her. But none succeeded. The king asked Andung to cure his daughter.

Andung was also sad to see the princess. She was so beautiful, and sadly she could not leave her room. She was very weak. Her illness forced her just to stay in her room.
Andung put the necklace into the glass of water. He asked the princess to drink the water. And amazingly, she was cured. She was able to walk again. The king was extremely happy. He was so thankful to Andung. To show his gratitude, he asked Andung to marry the princess. Andung agreed. He then lived in the palace.

Later, the princess was pregnant. She wanted to eat a special fruit. However, the fruit was only found in the jungle. Andung then asked some soldiers to accompany him to go to the jungle.
Andung knew the jungle very much. It was not far from his house. On the way to the jungle, he saw his mother. She was very old and poor. His mother was very happy.

&quot;Andung? I&#39;m so happy to see you,&quot; said his mother.

Sadly Andung was ashamed with her. He did not want to admit her as his mother. &quot;Who are you? I don&#39;t know you,&quot; said Andung.

Her mother was very sad. She prayed to God to punish him. Andung suddenly could not move his body. He realize he was wrong. He tried to apologize to his mother but it was too late. Andung finally could not move his body at all. Slowly, he changed into a stone. The stone looked like a human dead body. It was slowly getting bigger and bigger. The stone then turned into a mountain. People named it as the mountain of human dead body or Gunung Bangkai.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="245" name="The Dandaung Snake" tags="" position="2048,433">A long time ago, there was a big kingdom in South Kalimantan. The people lived happily and peacefully. There were no poor people. The land was fertile and they always had great harvest. The kingdom was also peaceful. The king was wise and always protected his people. The king had seven daughters. Those seven princesses were very beautiful. The king and the queen really loved them. Their daughters were all still single.

It was a beautiful afternoon. The king and his family spent their time in the garden. Suddenly the chief soldier came. He told the king a very bad news.

“Your majesty! A giant bird attacked our kingdom. The bird is destroying the rice fields. It is also attacking the people. Many people are wounded,” said the soldier.

“We have to do something. Prepare the soldiers. I’ll command the attack,” said the king bravely. He then took his weapon and led the soldiers.

When the king and the soldiers arrived, they were very shocked. The bird was very big. It was very powerful and mean. The king did not want to wait any longer.

The king and the soldiers fought bravely. At first, they could not match the fight. However they all were very brave. Slowly the giant bird gave up. It was very tired and stopped its attack. The people were happy. For a moment they were safe from the bird.

A week later, the kingdom was restless again. This time a giant snake came to the palace. Amazingly the snake could talk like humans. The snake wanted to meet the king and his family.

“Your Majesty, my name is Dandaung Snake. I’m here to marry one of your seven daughters,” said the snake.

All the daughters were screaming. They all were afraid. However the king was silent and calmed. He knew he had to be very careful. He tried to find a solution.

“I cannot decide right now. We need to discuss. Come back tomorrow,” said the king.

He planned to prolong the time. Meanwhile he also had to ask his daughters. One by one the king asked them, but they all refused to marry the snake.

The king was hopeless. He was afraid the snake would attack his kingdom, he still had problems with the giant bird. It was because the bird was still alive and it could return and attack the kingdom and his people at any time.

Suddenly his youngest daughter came to him.

She said, “Father, I’m willing to marry the snake. I’m afraid the snake will be angry and attack our kingdom if nobody wants to marry him.”

The king was speechless. He was very touched with her youngest daughter’s sacrifice. Then he ordered his people to hold a great wedding ceremony for her youngest daughter and Dandaung
Snake.

The party was great. All the guests were proud with the youngest princess. When everybody was having fun, suddenly something strange happened.

Dandaung Snake slowly changed into a very handsome man. He looked into the youngest princess face and he said.

“Don’t be afraid. You have already helped me from the curse. A bad witch cursed me into a snake. Actually I’m a prince and I have great supernatural power.”

The prince went away. He knew the people were still afraid with the giant bird. The prince wanted to kill the bird. And finally he succeeded! The giant bird was dead. Everybody was happy. The king was also happy. He asked the prince to be the new king. Since then the kingdom was always peaceful.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="246" name="Dewi Luing Indung Bunga" tags="" position="1923,433">PEOPLE in Kampung Datar, South Kalimantan, suffered. There has been disaster. Long drought has made them lack of water. Many people were ill. Children were crying because they were very hungry. Their parents could not work because they were too weak. They had not eaten much.

The head of the village was Datu Beritu Taun. He asked all the villagers to have a meeting. He wanted to discuss how to find the solutions of the problem. He knew God was angry with them. They had wasted all the blessing from God. Yes, previously their village was fertile. Water was easy to find. Their life was prosperous.

It all changed when the villagers cut down the trees recklessly in the jungle. After all the big trees were cut down, their village was flooded. It was very terrible. After that, long drought attacked their village.

“My fellow villagers, let’s find solutions for this disaster. We need a lot of water. Do you have any ideas?” asked Datu Beritu Taun, the head of the village, during the meeting.

“I think we have to dig to find well, Sir,” said one villager.

“But we are too weak to work,” said another villager.

“Well, if we don’t do anything, more people are going to die. I think we have to dig deeper to find the source of water,” said another villager.

“I agree. Now I want all the strong men to dig the land. We have to find water!” said Datu Beritu Taun.

Without waiting any longer, all strong men were busy digging. One of them was Antun Kumara Sukma. He was Datu Beritu Taun’s oldest son. Antun had a sister. Her name was Dewi Luing Indung Bunga. Days and nights the villagers were digging. In one night, Datu Beritu Taun had a dream while he was sleeping. In his dream, he heard that the village could be prosperous again if a girl was willing to be sacrificed. The girl had to be kind hearted and obedient to her parents.

When he woke up, Datu Beritu Taun told the men about his dream. He asked them to find a girl who was willing to be sacrificed. The villagers waited and waited… Sadly, no girl wanted to be sacrificed.

Dewi Luing Indung Bunga was a very kind girl. She knew she had to be sacrificed. She then told his father about it.

“Father, mother… I want this disaster to end. I want our people to be happy again. If there is no girl to be sacrificed, let me sacrifice myself,” said Dewi Luing Indung Bunga.

Though they were very sad, but the family let Dewi to sacrifice herself. All the villagers gathered in a big field. Dewi Luing Indung Bunga was standing in the middle. Suddenly, she fell down.

She died. Not long after that rain fell down heavily. All the villagers were thankful to God. They would never forget Dewi’s sacrifice to them. Since then the villagers were very careful to the forests. They did not want to cut down the trees recklessly. </tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="248" name="Queen Aji Bidara Putih" tags="" position="1673,558">ONCE upon a time in East Kalimantan, there was a kingdom in Muara Kaman.

The kingdom was led by Queen Aji Bidara Putih. She was a very beautiful queen. She was also wise, kind, and loving to her people.

The queen was single. Many kings and princes from other kingdoms have tried to propose her. However, she was still not interested in getting married.

She only wanted to take care of her people. Though the queen has rejected proposal from many rich men, the proposals kept on coming to her. Many kings and princes did not give up. One of them was a prince from China.

The Chinese prince came with a big ship.

He brought his soldiers and also a lot of jewelleries. The prince wanted to give the jewelleries as wedding proposals.When the ship arrived at Muara Kaman, the Chinese prince asked a messenger to meet the queen. The messenger then told the queen about the wedding proposal.Before I accept the proposal, please tell me about your prince, asked the queen.

He is a very rich man and also very handsome, Your Majesty.

&quot;Alright then, tell your prince I need time to think,&quot; said the queen.

The queen thought it was time for her to get married. She felt she was old enough. That was why she did not reject the proposal immediately. However, she did not want to choose the wrong husband. She asked one soldier to secretly go to the ship. The queen asked the soldier to describe her how the Chinese prince looked like. The soldier was finally able to enter the ship. He was peeping from a hole.

He saw the prince was eating. The soldier could not see the prince clearly. The hole was too small. But he could hear how the prince ate. The prince was eating using chopsticks.

He made strange sounds when he was eating. The soldier was so scared. He never heard that sound before. He thought the prince was not a real human. He thought the prince was a ghost! When he arrived back at the palace, the soldier immediately reported to the queen. He told the queen about the strange sound. 

&quot;Maybe he is not a human, Your Majesty. Maybe he is a ghost!&quot; said the soldier.

At first, the queen did not believe him.

But the soldier was very sure with what he heard. The queen then decided to refuse the wedding proposal. And that made the Chinese prince got very angry. He asked his soldiers to attack Muara Kaman kingdom. The Chinese soldiers were able to beat the Muara Kaman&#39;s soldiers. Queen Aji Bidara Putih was cornered in the palace. She then prayed to God.

Suddenly, she heard a voice. The voice asked her to chew betel then threw the betel to the Chinese soldiers.

Amazingly, the betel changed into giant centipedes and attacked them.

The Chinese soldiers died and from the ground appeared a lake. People of Muara Kaman then named it as Danau Lipan or Centipede Lake. And sometimes people could find pieces of antique Chinese porcelain in that lake.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="249" name="The Sacred Cow River" tags="" position="1800,565">A long time ago, there was a big kingdom in East Kalimantan. It was Kutai Kertanagera Kingdom. The king was King Aii Maharaja and he was the third king.

King Aji Maharaja had a big palace however he was still not satisfied. He thought his palace was not beautiful yet. He asked his Advisor what to do to make his palace look beautiful.

&quot;Your Majesty I heard there are great sculptors in Java. Why don&#39;t you ask the king in Java to send their best sculptors to decorate your palace to look beautiful?&quot;

The king thought it was a good idea. He sent his soldiers to meet the king in |ava. The king in Java agreed, he asked his best sculptors to go to Kutai Kertanagera Kingdom.

The king in Java sent two sculptors. They were brothers. They were the best sculptors in fava. People said that they had supernatural power.

The two sculptors came to KingAji Maharaja.

They asked, &quot;Your Majesry what kind of sculptures do you want?&quot;

&quot;I want the most beautifrrl sculptures in the world,&quot; replied the king.

The sculptors understood. They immediately worked. In just a month, the palace had changed completely. It had beautiful sculptures.

the king was satisfied. As a return, the king asked the two sculptures to stay in the palace. And he also gave them lots of gold,

Unfortunately that made the advisor jealous. He planned to make the sculptors leave the palace.

The advisor told the king that the two sculptors did something bad to the ladies-in-waiting. Sadly, the king believed him. He was angry! He asked the sculptors to leave the palace.

However the Advisor was not satisfled. He wanted them to die. So he said, &quot;Your Majesty, if they leave the palace, they will work for other kings. And they will make more beautifirl sculptures in other palaces. So, why don&#39;t you hang them to die?&quot;

&#39;Tou are rightl Guards, hangthem to die now!&quot; ordered the king.

The sculptors were brought to the open field. There were two poles with ropes. People were watching. They were sad, because they loved them. And they knew how bad the Advisor was but there was nothing they could do.

And right before they were hung, one of the scultor was able to escape. However one of them did not succeed. He died.

Before the sculptor died he cursed the king and the kingdom. He said, &quot;Ten will be destroyed and eleven will be a jungle.&quot;

What did the sculptor mean? Well, apparently he cursed that the kingdom would be destroyed at the tenth king and it would be completely gone and became a jungle at the eleventh king.

And it was happened. The tenth king of Kutai Kertanagera Kingdom was not able to make his kingdom exist after they lost the war with other kingdom and Kutai Kertanagera was completely gone and became a jungle during the eleventh king.

In the mean time after the sculptor died, King Aji Maharaja ordered the soldiers to throw the dead body to the Cow River. Amazingly, the dead body did not decay. People were amazed and because they respected him, they buried him near the river. People sacred the tomb and because of that they considered the Cow River as a sacred river.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="250" name="Nyapu and Moret" tags="" position="1925,565">&quot;HELP! Please help me!&quot; screamed an old man.

&quot;Ha ha ha, who can help you!&quot; mocked a beggar. Yes,. some beggars came to a village and stole the villagers&#39; belongings.

The villagers were so scared, the beggars brought Iots of weapons and they would hurt anyone who stopped them stealing. And after they were satisfled, the beggars left the village and brought &#39;&#39; the villagers&#39; belongings.

At night, the villagers had a meeting. They were trying to find the solution.

&quot;We have to leave this village and go to other place safer. I&#39;m sure the beggars will come back and steal our belongings. And I&#39;m worried they will hurt us,&quot; suggested a man. His name was Nyapu.

&quot;I don&#39;t agree. This is my place and I will not leave this village,&quot; said one man.

&quot;It&#39;s up to you, but my wife and I are going to leave this village and find q safe place. If you want to join me, we will leave tomorrow morning,&quot; offered Nyapu.

Early in the morning, Nyapu and his wife were ready to go. Some viJlagers joined them and the rest still stayed in the village. Nyapu led the group. He encouraged them when the villagers were tired. He told them that they would find a safe place.

After spending a difficult journey, they finally found a good place. They thought it was safe. Nyapu asked them to build houses. And after the houses were ready, they cultivated the land. The planted some trees. Yes, they continued their lives as farmers. They lived happily.

Months later, Nyapu had some guests. Who were they? Well, they were the villagers who still stayed in their old village. Sadly, not long after Nyapu and the villagers left their place, the beggars came. They stole and hurt the villagers.

They decided to leave the village and followed Nyapu. Nyapu welcomed them nicely. Their new place became a small community. And they chose Nyapu to become their leader.

The villagers were happy, they were safe from the beggars. And for Nyapu, his life was getting happier when his wife was pregnant. And when the baby was,born, all the villagers were also happy. Nyapu and his wife had baby girl and he named her Moret.

Moret grew as a beautifirl girl. Nyapu taught everything. Moret learned very well. She was very gratefuI. Her father did not only taught her about farming but also about leading. Nyapu planned to make Moret as the new leader.

Nyapu was old and as he planned, he asked Moret to be the leader. Moret agreed, she did not want to disappoint her beloved father. Sadly, not long after Moret became the new leader, the village suffered long drought. It was dried. The villagers badly needed the water. And when they were in the middle of the probIem, there came a young handsome man. His name was Karang. He had heard about Moret. He wanted to see how beautiful she was. And when he met her, Karang fell in love instantly. He wanted to marry her. He then proposed her.

Moret had a wish. She only wanted to marry a man who could bring safety and prosperity to her people. She then told Karang that she would marry him if he could make rain fall down.

Well, Moret did not know that Karang mastered supernatuial power: He also mastered great skills in martial arts. Karang easily did what Moret asked him to do. Rain fell down heavily. All the villagers were happy. And of course, Moret agreed to marry Karang. The couple live.d happily ever after. </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="251" name="The Legend of Pesut Mahakam" tags="" position="2055,568">A long time ago, there was a village in East Kalimantan. The village was near the Mahakam River. The villagers always worked hard. Although they were poor, they were very happy. They also helped each other.

In the village, there was a rich family. The head of the family was Pak Pesut. Everybody knew Pak Pesut. He was known not because of his wealth, but because his stinginess. He did not like to help others. His family always ignored people. That’s why Pak Pesut’s family always lived alone and never mingled with others.

It was a very long dry season. All the rice fields could not get water properly. The villagers could not harvest the rice.

Therefore, all villagers were planning to leave their village and find other place to stay. Then they sent some young men to look for a place that had enough water for their rice fields.

After several weeks looked for a new place, finally those young men arrived. They brought good news. There was a waterfall and it was enough to water their rice fields. Later, all the villagers rushed to the new place. Some villagers went to Pak Pesut’s house to inform about the waterfall. Although Pak Pesut was stingy, the villagers did not hate him.

“I’m not going with you! I will stay here. I have enough rice for my family.

We will survive!” said Pak Pesut arrogantly.

The villagers knew it was useless to ask Pak Pesut to join them. So, they all left him and his family alone in the village. When they arrived at the new place, they all were very happy. They had enough water from the waterfall.

In the mean time, Pak Pesut and his family were beginning to worry. Their rice slowly was gone. Soon they would not have enough rice to eat.

It was in the morning when Pak Pesut’s wife was cooking their last portion of rice. Suddenly, someone knocked the door. A beggar came to his house.

“Go out! I don’t have enough rice,” said Pak Pesut. He was lying.

“Please mercy me. I’m so hungry. Give me a little rice please,” asked the beggar.

Pak Pesut immediately asked his family to eat the rice. He was worried the beggar would enter his house and stole the rice.

“But the rice is still in the cooking pot. Mother is still cooking it. If we eat the rice, it will be very hot,” said his son.

“I don’t care! If you all don’t eat now, you will never eat again,” said Pak Pesut.

Later, Pak Pesut and his family ate the rice. It was very hot. They needed water to drink. They rushed to Mahakam River. It was so hot that they finally jumped to the river.

The beggar saw the incident. He then prayed to God. Amazingly, Pak Pesut family slowly changed into fish. The fish looked like dolphin. Since then, everybody named the fish as Pesut fish.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="252" name="Princess Bungsu and Maniki" tags="" position="2180,565">Once upon a time there was a king in Berau Kingdom. The king was wise. He had seven beautiful daughters and he did not have a son yet. Among the seven daughters, the most beautiful daughter was the youngest one. Her name was Princess Bungsu. She was a kind girl. She was not spoiled and liked to do the household chores and cooking. She had a special knife to cut the vegetables or meat.

One day the princess’ knife was broken. She was very sad. She did not want to cook anymore. The king loved his daughters very much. He did not want to see his youngest daughter sad.
Therefore the king had a competition. He asked the people to make a new knife for his daughter. The king would give great rewards for the winner.

Soon, everybody was busy making a knife. After they were finished, they brought the knives to the palace. One by one, the villagers showed their knives to Princess Bungsu. Sadly, the Princess was not interested. She thought that all the knives were not as beautiful as her knife.

On the following day, a young man came to the palace. His name was Maniki. He was handsome and very helpful to others and also skillful. He could make anything. Maniki also wanted to join the competition. He brought his knife and showed it to Princess Bungsu. The knife was very beautiful. Princess Bungsu liked it instantly. She immediately brought the knife to the kitchen and began to cook.

Princess Bungsu really loved the knife. She always kept the knife carefully. She even brought the knife to her bed room and put it on the pillow.

In one morning, Princess Bungsu did not feel very well. The king then asked the palace healer to cure the illness.

After a while, the palace healer was surprised. He found out that Princess Bungsu was pregnant! He immediately reported to the king.

The king was really angry. He asked the princess who the father of the baby was. The princess was confused. She always stayed in the palace and never had any contacts with any men.
Nine months later, the princess had a baby son.

The palace healer knew how to find out the father of the baby. He invited all men in the kingdom. Then he gave each of them a banana. If the baby crawled to the man holding the banana, then he was the father.

After all men came to the palace, they all sat down in a big circle. The baby was in the middle.
Amazingly the baby started to crawl. He came to a young man. It was Maniki!
Maniki was confused.

He said that he was innocent. But the king ignored him. Later the king sent Maniki, Princess Bungsu and the baby to the jungle as a punishment.

Days passed by and the baby turned to a boy. Maniki and Princess Bungsu were also rich. They worked hard and always saved their money. One day they heard that the king was terribly ill. They decided to go to the palace to visit the king.

It was true. The king was dying. He was terribly ill because he felt guilty by sending her daughter to the jungle. When he met Maniki and Princess Bungsu, the king apologized to them and asked them to stay in the palace.</tw-passagedata>

&quot;Don&#39;t go too long. Please come back soon,&quot; said Monondeaga.

Abo then left their house. Actually, he did not want to leave his wife alone, he had heard the Tulap was hungry. Tulap was a giant. He ate humans!

Not long after Abo left, Monondeaga heard heavy footsteps. She then remembered Abo&#39;s message. She had to hide under the bed. But it was too late. Suddenly, Tulap was breaking the front door.

&quot;Ha ha ha... Come here. I want to take you to my place,&quot; said Tulap.

Monondeaga was so scared. However, she finally had an idea.

&quot;Don&#39;t take me now. I haven&#39;t taken a bath yet. Come back tomorrow.&quot;

On the following day, Tulap was impatient.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to hear your excuses again!&quot;

He then grabbed Monondeaga and took her to his place.

Later, Abo went home. He called out his wife&#39;s name. But he could not find her. He then had a bad feeling. He was afraid that Tulap had taken her. He immediately rushed to Tulap place.

After several days, he finally arrived at Tulap&#39;s place. It was a big cave.

&quot;Tulap! Get out! Bring back my wife!&quot; screamed Abo.

Tulap then got out of his cave. He was so happy because there was a human came to his cave. He did not have to hunt him.

Abo was ready with his weapons and he immediately attacked him. Tulap was not ready with the attack. He thought Abo did not have any guts to fight him.

Abo did very hard to kill Tulap. Finally, he succeeded. Tulap was dead! Abo hurried entering Tulap&#39;s cave. He saw many people were inside the big cage. One of them was his beloved wife, Monondeaga.

Abo immediately opened the cage. Everybody inside the cage was so happy. They thanked Abo for his great courage. Abo and Monondeaga then went home. Now people could live peacefully. The giant was dead.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="255" name="Sigarlaki and Limbat" tags="" position="1798,433">A long time ago in Tondonao, there lived a great hunter. His name was Sigarlaki. He was very skillful with his spear. He used his spear to hunt animals in the jungle. He was a very famous hunter. Every time he hunts in the jungle, he always went home with some animals.

Sigarlaki had a servant. His name was Limbat. Sigarlaki was very lucky; Limbat had been always loyal to him. Everywhere Sigarlaki went hunting, Limbat was always next to him. As always, in one beautiful morning, Sigarlaki and Limbat went to the jungle to hunt some animals.

Sigarlaki prepared his great weapon, the spear. But, today was not his lucky day. They have looked for animals for several hours. For the first time in his life, Sigarlaki was not able to bring home an animal. Sigarlaki became angrier when Limbat told him that their food at home was stolen. Sigarlaki accused Limbat stealing the food.

Limbat was sad. He never thought that his master would accuse him as a thief. Then Sigarlaki asked Limbat to prove that he is innocent. Sigarlaki would throw his spear to a big pond. At the same time, Limbat had to jump also to the big pond. If the spear would come out from the water earlier than Limbat, it meant that Limbat was innocent; he did not steal the food.

However, if Limbat came out earlier than the spear, so he was guilty. That strange rule made Limbat very sad. But he really wanted to prove that he was not guilty. So he directly jumped to the pond when Sigarlaki threw his spear. But, when the spear reached the bottom of the pond, Sigarlaki saw a wild pig near the pond.

He immediately jumped to the pond and took his spear. Just before Sigarlaki was ready to throw his spear, the pig was gone. That automatically made Limbat innocent. The spear came out earlier than he was. Sigarlaki did not want to admit that. So he asked for the second chance. Just before he was ready to throw his spear, suddenly a big crab bit him.

&quot;Ouch! That&#39;s hurts!&quot; Sigarlaki was screaming in pain.

Seeing this, Limbat came to his master and helped him. Sigarlaki was ashamed. He already accused Limbat, instead Limbat helped him. He knew he got the punishment. A big crab bit him! </tw-passagedata>

The family was so poor. They could not eat regularly. They often spent the nights with empty stomach. Though their lives were miserable, they never complained.

The old woman was so grateful with her two daughters. They were helpful and got along very well. The two sisters never fought and always helped each other.

The two sisters were looking for some fruits to eat. They had been searching since morning unfortunately they were not lucky. They could not find any single fruit to eat.

They were resting under a big mango tree. They were so tired and hungry. They felt so weak. They had not eaten anything since last night.

&quot;I&#39;m so hungry&quot; said the younger sister.

&quot;Me too... Who can give us something to eat here?&quot; replied the older sister.

Suddenly, a bunch of bananas were dropped from the top of the tree.

&quot;Hey! It&#39;s bananas! But why are there bananas here? We are sitting under a mango tree? Who dropped these bananas?&quot; said the older sister.

While the two sisters were wondering about the bananas, they heard a bird singing.

&quot;Kekekow.... Kekekow....Kekekow&quot; sang the bird.

&quot;Look! It&#39;s aKekekow Bird!&quot; pointed the older sister.

Yes! There was a Kekekow Bird. People named it Kekekow Bird because it always sang.

&quot;Kekekow... Kekekow...&quot;

The two sisters immediately ate the bananas. While they enjoyed eating thebananas, the bird again.dropped other fruits. The two sisters were screaming happily. They immediately brought the fruits home.

On the following day, the two sisters went back to the mango tree. They hoped they could see the Kekekow Bird again. They wanted to say thank you.

The two sisters were sitting under the mango tree. They heard the Kekekow Bird singing. The two sisters immediately stood up and looked up to the sky, looked for the bird;

&quot;Look! That&#39;s the bird! Hey... Kekekow Bird! We&#39;re here!&quot; said the younger sister.

The Kekekow Bird perched on the branch on the mango tree and began singing melodiously.

&quot;Kekekow Bird, we want to thank you because yesterday you gave us lots of fruits. Well, we are poor and we don&#39;t have any money to buy food. So, when you gave us fruits yesterday, we were so happy,&quot;.said the older.sister.

Suddenly, the Kekekow Bird dropped them lots of money. The two sisters could not believe what they saw. They collected the money. After saying thank you, they went home.

They were not poor anymore. They were rich! People were so curious. They asked how the two sisters got the money. well, the two sisters were honest girls. They told them that they got the money from the Kekekow Bird.

People came to the mango tree. They all asked for lots of money. Though they were not poor, they still asked for lots of money. They were so greedy!

The Kekekow Bird did not drop them money. Instead, the bird dropped them grass! People were so angry! They thought the bird was making fun of them. They caught the bird and killed it.

The two sisters were so sad. They buried the bird properly. To show gratitude, the two sisters always help poor people.</tw-passagedata>

The old man was scared to death. &quot;I.. I.. I.. am looking for some firewood.&quot;

The giant was looking carefully at the old man. &quot;I am not hungry now, but I will eat him later. I have to take him to my house,&quot; said the giant to himself.

&quot;Hey Old Man, I need your help to catch some animals. I&#39;m hungry and I want to eat them,&quot; said the giant.

The old man was still scared. He did not know what to do. He wanted to run away but he knew it was useless. The giant could catch him. He planned to do what the giant said. He would escape when the time was right.

&quot;Okay Mr Giant, what should I do?&quot; asked the old man.

&#39;Just follow me. I&#39;m going home now,&quot; said thee giant.

They both walk. Later. they saw a big mouse. The mouse was so scared. He wanted to run away but the giant caught him.

&quot;Ha ha ha... don&#39;t be afraid. Follow us now&quot; said the Giant. He was so happy that he got
another food.

The giant, the old man, and the mouse were walking. Then they saw a centipede. The centipede was also scared. Again, the giant asked the centipede to join them.

The old man mouse and the  told the centipede to calm down.

&quot;I have a plan to escape. Listen, we do this after the giant is sleeping. First, you, mouse, bite the giant&#39;s ear, then, when he washes the blood, you centipede, sting him. I will do the rest,&quot; said the old man.

Later, they arrived at the giant&#39;s house. He was so tired. He asked the old man, the mouse, and the centipede to sleep in his house. He planned to eat them tomorrow.

The old man pretended to sleep. After he was sure that the giant was sleeping, he told the mouse to climb the giant&#39;s bed.

The mouse did it carefully. The old man asked the centipede to go to the bowl, there was water in the bowl and the centipede stayed inside the bowl. The giant always used it to wash his face. Then the old man whispered to the mouse.

&quot;Now bite his ear.&quot;

The mouse bit the giant&#39;s ear very hard. The giant was screaming in pain.

&quot;Ouch... that hurts!&quot; He was bleeding. He went to the bowl to clean the wound. He did not know that the centipede was waiting for him.

The giant washed his ear. The centipede immediately stung him. The giant again screamed loudly- He was in a great pain. The centipedes poison made him lost his balance. The giant fell down.

The old man grabbed a chair and hit him repeatedly! The giant was too weak to fight back Then he died.

The old man. the mouse, and the centipede were happy. They immediately left the giant&#39;s house and went home. </tw-passagedata>

A long time ago, gods and humans could interact one to another. They could meet, see, and talk among them. Gods lived in the sky and humans lived on earth. Gods often went to earth and humans also could visit the gods in the sky.

They used two mountains to travel. Those two mountains were Lokon and Soputan. The two mountains were very high. Gods could climb down the mountains anytime they liked. However, human could only climb up the mountains once a year. And not every human could do that. Only special humans could visit the gods in the sky.

The gods gave tight selection to humans who wanted to visit them. Humans who were allowed to meet the gods were very happy. T&#39;hey always told everybody about the gods&#39; place in the sky. They rvere amazed with the beauty of the sky. Other humans who heard the story were jealous. They also wanted to see the beauty of the gods&#39; place in t1-re sky.

One of the humans who really wanted to go to the sky was Warereh. He had been dreaming that someday he could go to the sky. He wanted to have a better life. He knew that the gods had the secrets of everything.

He wanted to be like his friends who could go to the sky. Their lives had changed. They were richer and smarter. They had been told about the secrets of lives by gods. The gods had selected one person to visit them.in the sky. Warereh was upset! He was angry. He had been r.r.aiting for a long time and still he had to wait for another year.

Warereh silently climbed up Lokon Mountain. He climbed it silently. The mountain was very big and high. He had been climbing for months. And finally, he was at the top of the mountain.

Warereh was very happy. Although he was not at the gods&#39; place, he could hear the gods&#39; conversation. Unfortunately, one of the gods found out that Warereh was hiding and trying to hear their conversation. The gods were angry!

&quot;Hey! Who are you?&quot;

&quot;My name is Warereh and I want to visit you all.&quot;

&quot;Absolutely no! You know the rule. One human can visit us once a year.&quot;

&quot;But I have been waiting for a long time.&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t care. That&#39;s the ruIe.&quot;

Warereh was helpless. He could not fight the gods. They were very powerful. Warereh thought the gods were arrogant. He wanted to give them a lesson. He had a crazy idea. He wanted to cut the mountains. So both gods and humans could not meet each other.

Warereh was looking for a tool that could help him cut the two mountains. He went to many great people. They said that Warereh&#39;s idea was crazy and they could not help him give the tool. Warereh then finally gave up. He did not want to seek other people&#39;s help. He had to make the tool by himself.

And after thinking very hard, he finally had a great idea. He made a very big sword. The sword n,as also very sharp. It &#39;could cut anything. And after the sword was ready, he again climbed Lokon Mountain. He slowly cut the top of the mountain.

Ahd after it was done, he threw the top part of the mountain. Later it became a new mountain. People named it Klabat Mountain. Iater he dimbed Soputan Mountain. He then cut the top part of the mountain. He threw the part of the mountain to the sea, and it became a nelv mountain. People named the mountain as Manado Tua Mountain.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="259" name="Wuwung Sewe and The Crocodile" tags="" position="2180,440">A long time ago in Minahasa, there lived a fisherman. His name was Wuwung Sewe. He lived with his family near a river. Wuwung Sewe was a kind man. He liked to help other people.

Every day Wuwung Sewe went to the river to catch some fish. And after he caught the fish he sold them in the market. He liked his job very much.

It was a beautiful day. Wuwung Sewe was at the side of the river. He was ready to catch the fish. Suddenly he heard someone was asking for help.

&quot;Help... Please, somebody help me....&quot; Wuwung Sewe was looking around but he did not see anyone. He kept on looking but still, he did not see anyone at the river.

Wuwung sewe then walked along the riverside. The voice of asking was getting clearer and louder. Wuwung Sewe was sure that he, was getting closer. And finally, he found the source of the voice asking for a help.

It was not a man asking for a help, but it was a crocodile! And it was a very big crocodile. Wuwung Sewe was very scared. He was so shocked to see a crocodile was able to talk like humans.

&quot;Please, help me, there is a spear in my back. It&#39;s so painful....&quot; said the crocodile.

&quot;What happened?&quot; asked Wuwung Sewe after he was calmed down.

&quot;A hunter was trying to kill me. He threw his spear at me. Luckily I was able to save my life. The spear is still in my back. Can you please pull it out?&quot;

Wuwung Sewe was actually very scared. However, he was very sorry to see the condition of the crocodile. He wanted to help the crocodile.

&quot;Are you ready? I will pull it out now. Please hold, it might feel so painful,&quot; said Wuwung Sewe.

With a great effort, he pulled the spear out. It was not easy for him, but finally he succeeded.

&quot;Thank you very much. You already helped me. Now what can I do for you?&quot; asked the crocodile.

Wuwung Sewe suddenly remembered his children. He did not allow his children to play at the river side. He was afraid that crocodile would hurt his children. He then had an idea.

&quot;Mr Crocodile, my wish is simple. From now on don&#39;t hurt my family,&quot; said Wuwung Sewe.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I will ask my family and my friends not to hurt your family,&quot; said the crocodile.

Wuwung Sewe was very,happy. He was glad that he did not have to worry when his children played near the river. He had a friend who would guard his children. And his friend was the crocodile!</tw-passagedata>

The animals often always destroyed the villagers&#39; fields. The villagers were very grateful. With Lawongo&#39;s help, their field were safe from the wild hogs.

Lawongo was also very great in playing a flute, it was so melodious. Everybody always enjoyed listening his playing the flute. One of the people was a beautiful girl. She always listened attentively. Lawongo knew there was a beautiful girl who always paid attention to him. Lawongo fell in love with her. The girl also loved him, later they got married.

They were very happy. They loved each other and promised to be always together. They would be together until they died.

In one night, Lawongo had a strange dream. In his dream he was hunting a very big wild hog. The hog attacked him. He did very hard to kill the hog. He used his knife to stab the hog and it finally died.

On the next morning, Lawongo went hunting. It was still early in the morning and he did not want to wake his wife up.

In the jungle ha did not see any animals. He could not find any wild hog either. He felt very strange. He walk and he felt very thirsty. He picked a coconut. And when he wanted to open it using his knife, he saw his knife was full of dried blood. He was confused. Suddenly he remembered his wife. Somehow he had a bad feeling about his wife. He immediately went home.
When he arrived home, many people were in front of his house. One of the people said,&quot;We&#39;re sorry for your wife, Lawongo. Please accept our condolences.&quot;

&quot;What happened?&quot; asked him. He rushed into his house. He saw his wife was dead. Her body was full of blood. Lawongo was very sad. He felt very guilty. He knew last night he stabbed hi wife. He then told the villagers to do something.

&quot;I cannot live without my wife. Please prepare two coffins, one for me and the other one is for my wife.&quot;

&quot;No, please don&#39;t do it. You are still young and we still need you here. Besides that we still want to hear you play the flute.&quot; said one of the villagers.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I still play the flute for you. Male a hole on the coffin&#39;s cover. If you cannot longer hear my playing, it means I&#39;m dead. You go to the beach. A strange thing will appear from the sea. Do not point at that thing and do not say anything. It is my reincarnation.&quot; said Lawongo.

Later, the villagers buried the two coffins. At the first night, they could still hear his playing. However the sound was getting weaker and weaker. And finally the villagers did not hear anything.

They did Lawongo&#39;s request. They went to the beach. They all set down on the beach. Suddenly, a strange thing appeared from the sea. It was very big. They all were surprised. However they did not say anything. The thing finally stooped growing.

The villagers used their sampan and came to the thing. It was a coral island. They named the island as Napombalu, which is from the words Napo and Nawalu. Napo means a coral island and Nawalu means a strange thing which turn into an island. </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="261" name="The Legend of Moopoo Bird" tags="" position="2030,183">A long time a go in Minahasa lived an old man with his grandson. The grandson’s name was Nondo. The old man loved Nondo very much.

He was a nice and diligent boy. When his grandfather went to the jungle to collect some ﬁre woods, Nondo stayed at home. He always did the household chores.

Nondo always wanted to join his grandfather to the jungle. However, his grandfather did not allow him. Nondo was limped. He could not walk well.

His grandfather always went to jungle in the morning and returned home in the afternoon. In the evening, just before bedtime, the grandfather always told Nondo anything that happened in
the jungle.

Nondo really enjoyed listening about the animals in the jungle. Nondo always dreamed of going to the jungle and seeing the animals.

On one morning, Nondo could not hold his feeling anymore. He begged to his grandfather.
He really wanted to go to the jungle and see the animals.

“Please, Grandpa. Let me join you. Just this time, please,” Nondo begged. The old man did not want to disappoint his beloved grandson.

After thinking deeply, he then said, “You can join me this time. But you have to be near me, okay? I will bring the woods, so I cannot see you all the time.”

Nondo was so happy. He promised to his grandfather that he would always be near him. Nondo could not wait to see the animals.

Then, they left the house. And finally they arrived at the jungle. At ﬁ rst, Nondo was able to walk near his grandfather.

However soon, the distance was getting farther. Every time Nondo saw an animal, he always stopped for a moment. He was really amazed. The grandfather always reminded Nondo not to stop walking. Sadly, Nondo was so happy looking at the animals. He ignored his grandfather’s warning.

Soon, Nondo was lost in the jungle. He was separated from his grandfather.

“Grandpa! Grandpa! Where are you? Grandpa, don’t leave me here,” Nondo screamed
.
Slowly, darkness covers the forest. Nondo was really scared. The sounds of the animals really frightened him. He kept on calling his grandfather.

Meanwhile, the grandfather just realized that his grandson was lost. He looked for Nondo and called out his name. But still he could not ﬁnd Nondo.

The grandfather was really sad. He regretted to let Nondo join him. The grandfather decided to go back home. He hoped Nondo would already arrive at home. Unfortunately, Nondo did not come home yet.

In the morning, the grandfather went to the jungle again. He wanted to ﬁ nd Nondo. And when he arrived in the jungle, he saw a bird.

The bird made a strange sound. It said, “Moo poo... Moo po...”

The grandfather was really curious. He never heard a bird make a sound like that. He looked at the bird carefully, and again the bird said, “Moo poo...”

Then he felt very strange. He felt that the bird said, “Opoku... Opoku...” It means “My grandpa... My grandpa...” Being really curious, he approached the bird. He was very surprised because the bird was limped.

The grandfather cried. He remembered his grandson. He was sure that his grandson had changed into a bird. Since then, people named the bird as Moopoo bird. It can be found in

<tw-passagedata pid="263" name="I Karake&#39;lette" tags="" position="1673,683">BALANIPA was a small kingdom in Mandar, West Sulawesi. The people lived happily and prosperously. The land was fertile and people enjoyed good harvest. And sadly that made other kingdoms become jealous. And they wanted to occupy Balanipa!

One of the kingdoms that wanted to occupy Balanipa was Gowa Kingdom. It was a big kingdom! Gowa had lots of soldiers with great weapons and they were ready to attack Balanipa.

&quot;What should we do, Your Majesty?&quot; asked the Chief of Commander to King Balanipa. He just reported to the king that King Gowa and his soldiers were sailing to Balanipa to occupy them.

&quot;We don&#39;t have enough soldiers to have war against them,&quot; the Chief continued.

&quot;Well, tell all the men in the kingdom that we need them. Tell them that we will recruit them as our soldiers!&quot; ordered the king.

The Chief immediately made an announcement. Soon many men came to the palace to register. They were eager to join the king to defend their kingdom against Gowa Kingdom.

Men came to the palace. One of them was I Karake&#39;lette. He was old and his physical condition
was not good. He was lame, he could not walk well.

&quot;\What are you doing here?&quot; asked one soldier.

&quot;I want to be a soldier and fight against Gowa,&quot; replied I Karake&#39;lette.

People werp laughing at him. Ohe man said, &quot;You are old and lame, why don&#39;t you just go home!&quot;

They rejected I Karake&#39;lette to be a soldier. He did not have any other choices. He went home.

In the meantime, soldiers of Gowa Kingdom had arrived at Mandar Port. King Gowa led his soldiers in his big ship.

The soldiers from the two kingdoms were fighting! Unfortunately, Gowa kingdom had more soldiers with better weapons. In just a minute, lots of soldiers from Balanipa Kingdom were killed. The chief asked the remaining soldiers to go back to the palace.

I Karake&#39;lette knew that they were about to lose the war. He went to the king. He said, &#39;Your Majesty please let me join your soldiers. I promise you that I can kill King Gowa.&quot;

King Balanipa was so touched to see I Karake&#39;lette&#39;s spirit. He was old and lame however he had great motivation to defend the kingdom. And the king finally lel him join the soldiers. After all, he already lost too many soldiers. He needed any help!

When they arrived at Mandar Port, I Karake&#39;lette sneaked to the King Gowa&#39;s ship. He met the king!

&quot;Leave Balanipa and go hack to your place!&quot; ordered I Karake&#39;lette bravely.

King Gowa was laughing to see an old and lame man was threatening him. He said, &quot;If I don&#39;t want to leave Balanipa, what will you do?&quot; mocked the king.

&#39;I will kill you!&quot; yelled I Karake&#39;lette.

&quot;Ha ha ha... kill me now!&quot;

The two men were fighting terribly. Though he was old and lame, I Karake&#39;lette had mastered martial art very well. He was also skillful in using a knife. Soon, King Gowa was killed! And after they knew their king was dead, soldiers of Gowa Kingdom immediately went back home.

Balanipa soldiers were so happy! They all praised I Karake&#39;lette! And the king was also happy. He gave I Karake&#39;lette lots of gold. And he also asked I Karake&#39;lette to stay in the palace and become a soldier. People admired and honored I Karake&#39;lette. They never underestimated him anymore.</tw-passagedata>

The farmer even prayed, &quot;Dear God, if you give us a son, I will put him in a golden cradle.&quot;

One day, God answered their prayer! The wife was pregnant. They were very happy but it did not last long. The farmer was confused. He had promised to put his baby boy in a golden cradle. He knew he had to work hard to buy a golden cradle. He planned to go to ]ava to work. Before he left, he told his wife a message.

&quot;If the baby is a boy, please take care ofhim very well. However, if the baby is a girl, kill her!&quot; ordered the farmer.

Yes, he did not like daughters. The wife did not understand why her husband hated daughters. She just hoped that the baby was a boy.

The farmer went to&#39;Java by ship. It took months. When the farmer arrived in fava, the baby was born. lt was a baby girl! The wife was so sad. She loved the baby very much and she did not want to lose her.

The wife went to her sister&#39;s house. She lived in another viliage and she a,sked her to raise her baby. &quot;Please take care of her. My husband is hoping to have a baby boy and she asked me to kill the baby if the baby is a girl,&quot; the farmer&#39;s wife explained to her sister.

In order to convince her husband that she already killed the baby girl, the wife dug the land and built a grave.

Later the farmer went home from Java. He had worked very hard and he was finally able to buy a golden cradle.

He brought a golden cradle to home. He asked, &quot;Where is our baby?&quot;

&quot;I am so sorry. Our baby is a girl and I did what you asked me. I already killed her,&quot; said the wife. The farmer was so speechless. He had been dreaming to have a baby boy.

Meanwhile, the baby girl grew as a beautiful girl and one day she knew that her real parents lived in another village. She was so sad when she knew the reason why her parents did not want her.

The gul prayed to God. She did not want to live as a human anymore. She wanted to be a bird so she could fly and go anywhere she liked.

&quot;Dear God, please change me into a bird. I don&#39;t want to be a human anyrnore. I am so sad with my life. I want to go anywhere I like.&quot;

The girl kept on praying. She really wanted to be a bird. And her wish came truel She slowly changed into a beautiful bird.

The bird was so beautiful and she also had a great voice. The bird then went to her real parents&#39;house. The bird sang a song, &quot;I&#39;m very sad. My parents do not love me.&quot;

The bird was flying above her parents&#39;house. She kept on singing the song. It attracted her parents&#39; attention.

<tw-passagedata pid="265" name="I Tui Tuing" tags="" position="1928,691">THERE were a husband and a wife lived in Mandar, West Sulawesi. The husband was a ﬁsherman. They had been married for many years but they had no any children yet. Everyday they prayed to God. They never gave up asking God to give them a child.

“Dear God, please give us a child even though he looks like a tui-tuing ﬁsh,” prayed the couple.
Tui-tuing is a ﬂying ﬁ sh found in that area.

And ﬁnally God answered their pray, the wife was pregnant. And when the baby was born, they were surprised. The baby looked like a ﬁsh. The skin had scales, just like the body of a ﬁsh. They remembered their pray. But still they were very happy. They took care of the baby with
great love. They named him as I Tuing-Tuing. I Tuing-Tuing grew as a great boy. He was diligent and obedient to his parents.

Soon I Tuing-Tuing grew as a young man. It was time for him to get married. He asked his parents to ﬁ nd him a girl. The parents knew it was not easy to ﬁnd a wife for their child. They thought no girls wanted to marry him. However, they did not want to make him sad. So the parents went to the villagers’ houses, proposing any single girl to be their daughter-in-law.

And it happened as they thought. All the girls they met always rejected their marriage proposal. There was one last house they hadn’t visited yet. It was the merchant’s house.

The merchant lived in a very big house. He had six daughters. All the daughters looked very happy. Actually, the third daughter, Rukiah, was not happy. She was the most beautiful daughter and her sisters were very jealous to her. Therefore, they put charcoal dust on her body. Her white skin turned into dark.

In the meantime, I Tuing-Tuing’s parents arrived at the merchant’s house. After they explained the purpose of their visit, the merchant asked all his daughters to answer. All the daughters rejected! They also insulted I Tuing-Tuing as a ﬁsh.

Suddenly, Rukiah answered, “Yes, I will marry I Tuing-Tuing.”

All of his sisters were laughing. They said that Rukiah was crazy. They did not know that Rukiah did not want to live with them anymore.

I Tuing-Tuing was very happy. Finally, there was a girl who was willing to be his wife. He did not care although Rukiah’s skin was very dark. And after they got married, they lived in their own house. I Tuing-Tuing worked as a ﬁsherman and Rukiah stayed at home. Rukiah had lot of time washing her skin. Later, it was completely clean. She got her beauty back.

While she was waiting for her husband, a man knocked the door. Rukiah opened it and saw a handsome man in front of the door.

“Who are you?” asked Rukiah.

“My name is I Tuing-Tuing. Where is my wife?” he asked.

“You are lying. I Tuing-Tuing has ﬁsh scales in his body.”

“It is true. But after I got married, I’m cured.

My skin has changed into normal. By the way, who are you?” asked I Tuing-Tuing. He also did not recognize his wife.

“I’m Rukiah. My sisters have done a terrible thing to me. They put charcoal dust in my body.
But I have completely washed and cleaned my skin,” said Rukiah.

And they were very happy. They were not ugly anymore. All the villagers really admired their great looks. And Rukiah’s sisters were even more jealous to her.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="266" name="The Legend of Pamboang" tags="" position="2055,693">A long time ago, three men came to Majene, West Sulawesi. They wanted to open a new place. Those three men were brothers. They were I Lauase, I Lauwella, and I Labuqang.

They arrived in the beach. It was empty. No humans lived there. So the three brothers divided jobs among them.

I Lauase worked in the land. He wanted to open new fields for plantation. I Lauwella and I Labuqang worked on the beach. I Lauwella cleaned the beach from the seaweeds and I Labuqang covered the hole made by the crabs.

They worked hard everyday. And finally they succeeded. I Lauase had fields with so many trees, fruits and vegetables. I Lauwella and I Labuqang already cleaned the beach from the seaweeds and the covered the holes.

One by one people came to their place. And slowly it became a new village. The three brothers were the leaders of the village. They thought they had to find a name for their village.

“I have an idea. Let’s name it Pallayarang Tallu,” said I Lauase.

“What does it mean,” asked I Lauwella.

“Well, Pallayarang means ship pole and Tallu means three,” explained I Lauase.

They all agreed. Since then they named the village as Pallayarang Tallu. More and more people came to Pallayarang Tallu. The village was growing into a small town.

The name Pallayarang Tallu was so famous. One man was interested to know more about the new town. His name was Puatta Di Karena. He was from Passokkorang kingdom. He went to Pallayarang Tallu with many people.

They were refugees. Their kingdom was attacked by their enemy. They came to Pallayarang Tallu to ask for help. The leader, Puatta Di Karena came to I Lauase’s house.

“Our kingdom is attacked. Can you help us?” asked Puatta Di Karena.

“I’m not the only leader here. I have to discuss with my brothers,” answered I Lauase.

Later, the three brothers held a meeting. After that they met Puatta Di Karena to tell him about their decision.

“We cannot help you. We don’t have enough soldiers yet. You can see that Pallayarang Tallu is a new town. There are not so many people live here,” explained I Lauase.

“But we really need your help. Pallayarang Tallu is the nearest town from our kingdom. Besides that, the three of you are very strong men. You can build this town. It means you have great power. I’m sure we can win if you help us,” said Puatta Di Karena.

He continued, “If you help us, I will give you tambo.”

Tambo means fee or money.

The three brothers then discussed. They needed more money. And the tambo could be used to build Pallayarang Tallu.

“When will you give us the tambo?” asked I Lauase.

“Next week,” answered Puatta Di Karena.

Then the people of Pallayarang Tallu helped them. They won! However Puatta Di Karena did not show up yet. He disappeared. Nobody knew where he was. The people of Pallayarang Tallu always talked about the tambo.

Slowly the word tambo changed into tamboang, then changed into pamboang. Since then the people changed the name Pallayarang Tallu into Pamboang. Pamboang is an area in Majene, West Sulawesi.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="267" name="Samba’ Paria" tags="" position="2188,696">A long time ago in Mandar, West Sulawesi, lived a beautiful girl named Samba’ Paria. She lived with her younger sister in a hut. Their hut was in the jungle. They both lived alone. Their parents had died. Samba’ Paria loved her younger sister very much. They always helped each other.

One night they had a dinner. Suddenly someone knocked the door.

“Who is that?” asked Samba’ Paria.

“We are the soldiers and the king. We are lost in the jungle. We are hunting here,” said one man.

Samba’ Paria then opened the door. There were some soldiers and the king! Samba’ Paria was very nervous. She did not know what to do. She was speechless.

“May we come in?” asked the king.

“Yes, you can,” answered Samba’ Paria.

And when the king was inside the house, he was amazed by Samba’ Paria’s beauty. He never saw a beautiful girl like her. The king fell in love with her. However he had a bad plan. He wanted to kidnap Samba’ Paria and brought her to the palace. He was thinking and fi nally he had an idea.

“I want to drink water from the waterfall. And I want your sister to go to the waterfall and bring me the water,” said the king.

In a hurry, the sister went to the waterfall. Right after she left, the king immediately asked the soldiers to take Samba’ Paria. She tried to release herself. But it was useless.

The soldiers were too strong. She knew she could not escape, so she grabbed some leaves and put them one by one on the way to the palace.

Later, the younger sister arrived at home. She was so confused. No one was at home . The door was open. She was crying and screaming her sister’s name. Suddenly she saw some leaves on the ground. She followed the leaves and finally she arrived in the palace.

“Kakak Samba’, are you there? If you are in the palace, please show me yourself in the window,” asked the sister.

The king heard that. Actually Samba’ Paria was locked in the room and she could not show herself because the room did not have any windows. The king wanted the sister to think that Samba’ Paria did not want to see her anymore. So he put a cat in the window.

The sister was surprised to see a cat in the window. She thought her older sister did not want to see her anymore. So she went home crying.

Samba’ Paria was also sad. The king asked her to marry him. But she did not want to. Days and nights she was locked in the room. She was always thinking about her younger sister.

She knew her sister needed her very much. Samba’ Paria prayed to God. She asked God to help her escape from the palace. God heard her prayer. In one night, she was able to escape! She ran very fast and finally she arrived at home.

The two girls hugged each other. They were crying. This time they cried because they were very happy. Samba’ Paria knew the king would follow her. So the two girls set a trap. She prepared some chilies and later she was grinding them. Finally, she mixed it with water. She wanted to throw the water to king’s face.

And it worked! And when the king arrived at their home, Samba’ Paria threw the water to the king’s face. The king’s screamed in pain. He fell and his head hit a big stone. He died instantly. Since then Samba’ Paria lived peacefully with her younger sister.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="268" name="Hawadiyah" tags="" position="1930,440">The people of Mandar were farmers. Most of them worked for a rich man. He hired the villagers to work in his coconut plantation. The rich man had a beautiful daughter. Her name was Bekkandari. She had a best friend. Her name was Hawadiyah. Unlike Bekkandari, Hawadiyah was a poor girl. She lived with her mother in a hut. Hawadiyah was also beautiful.

Many people said she was more beautiful than Bekkandari. It was harvest time. The villagers worked very hard in the plantation. Hawadiyah helped her mother collect the coconuts. Bekkandari’s father gave coconuts as the fee for the villagers. The more they collected the coconuts, the more Bekkandari’s father gave them the fee.

After it was finished, Hawadiyah’s mother received five coconuts. She immediately grated and cooked them in order to get the coconut oil. She then brought the coconut oil to Bekkandari’s father. Other villagers also brought the coconut oil to him. Bekkandari’s father would sail to Java to sell his coconut oil. The villagers also wanted to sell their coconut oil, so they brought it to Bekkandari’s father.

Hawadiyah’s mother really wanted to see her daughter to get married. She prayed to God. She hoped the man who bought her coconut oil would marry her daughter.

Later Bekkandari’s father and his men sailed the sea. When they arrived in Java, Bekkandari’s father sold the coconut oil to a rich merchant. He was young and handsome. When he bought the coconut oil from Hawadiyah’s mother, the merchant felt something strange. He saw a picture of a beautiful girl in the coconut oil. The merchant could not forget about her. Later he decided to go to Mandar to find the beautiful girl.

When he arrived, the merchant went around. He met Bekkandari’s father. He brought the merchant to his house. He introduced the merchant to his daughter, Bekkandari. She loved him instantly.

She tried to approach the merchant. However, it was not Bekkandari’s face he saw in the coconut oil. So he ignored her. Finally, the merchant met Hawadiyah. He was so happy finally he found the girl of his dream. The merchant went to Hawadiya’s house to propose her. The proposal was accepted and they were going to get married in the merchant’s house in Java. Bekkandari was jealous.

She planned something bad. She told the merchant that she was also going to Java to accompany Hawadiyah. Before the wedding, Bekkandari threw hot oil to Hawadiyah’s face. Hawadiyah was very sad. She was not beautiful anymore. She ran away and hid in a jungle.

The merchant was confused. Hawadiyah was missing. He asked all his men to find her. In the mean time, Bekkandari kept on telling the merchant that Hawadiyah ran away, and she was ready to be her wife.

Again, the merchant ignored her. In the jungle, Hawadiyah made friend with the animals. They were sorry to see her life. They suggested Hawadiyah to take a bath in magic pond in the jungle. Amazingly after she took a bath, she got her beauty back.

And when the merchant’s men found her, they immediately brought her to the merchant’s house. Hawadiyah told him about everything. The merchant was really angry. He asked his men to get rid of Bekkandari from his house. Later the merchant and Hawadiyah got married. Her mother was happy to see Hawadiyah to get married and have a happy life.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="269" name="The Legend of Pattuddu Dance" tags="" position="2055,566">ONCE upon a time in Mandar, West Sulawesi, there was a kingdom. The king and the queen had a handsome prince. He was still single. The prince was a diligent man. The palace had a beautiful garden and a pond. There was also waterfall in the pond. The prince always spent his time in the garden. He loved gardening and always took care of the plants.

In one afternoon, rain fell heavily. After it stopped, the prince went to the garden. On the way to the garden, he saw a beautiful rainbow. The rainbow ended in the pond. There were seven doves flying through the rainbow and they stopped flying above the pond. Amazingly, those seven doves turned into beautiful angels. They put their shawls on the ground then they all swam in the pond.

The prince watched them. He was amazed by their beauty and wanted to marry one of them. He stole one of the shawls and hid it. After all, those angels finished taking a bath and one by one they wore their shawls and changed back as a dove. However, the youngest angel could not find her shawl. She cried and then made a promise.

&quot;If a man finds my shawl, I will marry him. And if a woman finds my shawl, I will treat her as my own sister,&quot; said the angel.

The prince heard the promise. He then pretended to help her. Because they could not find the shawl, then the prince asked the angel to stay with him in the palace. The angel agreed because without her shawl she could not fly back to her home in heaven.

Then the prince and the angel got married. Later, they had a baby boy. They loved their son very much. The prince and the angel took care of their son lovingly.

In one morning, the angel wanted to enter one room. She wanted to use the room for their baby. The room was locked and the prince always forbade her to enter the room. Because she really wanted her son to sleep in the room, she ignored her husband warning.

When she was inside the room, she was surprised. She found her shawl. She then knew that her husband stole her shawl and never planned to return it.

The angel immediately wore her shawl. She then came to her husband.

&quot;My Dear Husband, I have found my shawl. Now I want to go back home to heaven. Please take care of our son. And if you miss me, just look at the rainbow.&quot;

The angel then waggled her shawl. Slowly, she flew to the sky. The prince was very sad. He just lost his beautiful wife. And every time he missed her, he always looked at the rainbow.

The people of Mandar, West Sulawesi, then imitated the way the angel waggling her shawl into movements of a dance. The dance is known as Pattuddu Dance.</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="271" name="Tadulako Bulili" tags="" position="1905,183">BULILI was a village in Central Sulawesi. The people lived happily and peacefully. The village had three guardians and they were called Tadulako. They were Tadulako Bantaili, Makeku, and Molove.

They were very strong and had great skill in martial arts. They were also skillful with weapons. They were brave and loyal. The people loved them very much. Thanks to them, their village was always safe.

There was a very beautiful girl in Bulili. Some people said that she was the most beautiful girl in the world. Wherever she went, men were always staring at her. They were amazed with her beauty. And they would be very happy when the girl smiled at them.

King Sigi had heard about the beautiful girl living in Bulili. He was single and wanted to marry. He wanted to have a queen and later had children. He hoped his child one day could replace him as a king. But first he had to find a perfect woman to marry.

King Sigi was curious with the beautiful girl in Bulili. He went to Bulili and wanted to see her.

&quot;Your Majesty, welcome to our village,&quot; said the head of the Bulili village.

&quot;Thank you. I&#39;m here because I heard there is a beautiful girl here. May I see her?&quot;

And after the king saw the girl, he was extremely happy. She was very beautiful. He was in love with her. And he thought that she would be a perfect queen for him.

The king did not want to waste time. He asked the girl to marry him. The girl agreed. And the wedding was immediately set.

After they got married, the king and the girl lived in Bulili. At first they lived happily. However slowly, they started to have arguments. They always quarreled about small things. And that made the king unhappy. He wanted to go back to his kingdom. He told his wife that he had to take care of his kingdom. Then he left. He did not know that when he left, his wife was Pregnant.

And nine months after the king left the village his baby was born. The head of the village asked Tadulako Bantaili and Tadulako Makeku to go to the palace. Meanwhile, Tadulako Molove stayed at the village.

The head of the village asked Tadulako Bantaili and Tadulako Makeku to go to the palace to see the king. First they had to tell him that his baby was born and second they asked the king to give some rice for the baby.

&quot;Really? I have a son?&quot; said the king when Tadulako Bantaili told him about his baby.

The king did not like the news. Apparently he did not love his wife anymore and wanted to leave her forever.

&quot;No! I will not give you any rice!&quot; replied the king when Tadulako Makeku asked him to give some rice for the baby.

&quot;Forgive us, Your Majesty. You give us no other choice. We will take the rice with or without your permission,&quot; said Tadulako Bantaili.

Tadulako Bantaili and Tadulako Makeku left the palace and went to the rice barn. with their power, they lifted the rice barn easily and brought it to the Bulili village.

The king was angry! He asked his soldiers to chase them and bring the rice barn back.

The Tadulako ran very fast and when they arrived at the river, they jumped and landed at the other side of the river easily.

The soldiers could not do anything. They did not have any power to jump across the river. And they went back to Sigi disappointingly. </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="272" name="The Story of Payol Village" tags="" position="1401,351">DAESALA was a fisherman. He lived with his wife and his son. His wife&#39;s name was Daesurnandi
while his son&#39;s name was Daemaji.

One day, the family went to an isolated island. The island had lots of trees and they wanted to get some firewood.

The family was busy collecting the wood and they did noi realize that lheir small boat was drifted by the waves.

When the family was finished collecting the wood, they looked for the boat. Their boat was gone! They were so panicky!

&quot;Father, how can we go home?&quot; asked Daemaji to his father.

The father was clueless. He did not have any ideas how to go back home without their boat. While they were thinking, suddenly they saw Payol fish. It was a flsh that only found in their waters:

&quot;Father, look! There is Payol fish over there!&quot; Daemaji screamed loudiy.

The father in immediately called out. &quot;Payol fish! Payol fish!&quot; He was waving his hand, as if asking the fish to come closer.

Strangely, the fish seemed to understand what the father meant. The fish approached the family. The family was extremely happy.

The father said, &quot;Payol fish, please help us. We want to go home but we lost our boat.

&quot;Amazingly, the fish was able to talk like i humans. The fish answered,

&quot;Just get on my back.&quot;

The family one by one was sitting on the fish&#39;s back. After that, the fish swam and left the island. They spent hours in the sea and strangely the fish did not swim towards the family&#39;s home. Daemaji was so scared.

&quot;Father, where are we going? Why don&#39;t we go home?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, Son. Just wait and see where we are going,&quot; replied the father.

The mother was also trying to console Daemaji.

&quot;]ust be patient. I&#39;m sure the fish will he1p us,&quot; said the mother.

They spent days on the sea and amazingly the family was never hungry and thirsty. Exactly on the seventh day, they saw an island. The fish slowly&quot;approached the island.

&quot;Please get off from my back &quot; asked the fish. After the whole family was on the heach, the fish again said.

&quot;This is Your new home, It is much better than your previous one. You can get anything here. But I want you to promise something. Please name this place after my name. It&#39;s Payol,&quot; said the fish.

After that, it swam back to the sea.

The family slowly looked around the island. The father looked so happy.

&quot;I think the fish is right. This place&#39;is much betler than our old home. We have lots of trees and fruits,&quot; said the father.

&quot;Yes, I agree,&quot; said the mother.

&quot;We don&#39;t have to worry to find firewood and fruits,&quot; continued the mother.

The family slowly built their house. Not long after that, a ship came. Some people went to the island and talked to Daesala.

&quot;This place is beautiful. What is the name?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Payol!&quot; said Daesala proudly.

The people asked Daesala&#39; permission if they could stay in the island. Daesala let them stay. Slowly, more and more people came. Finally it became a village. They named the village as Payol Village.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="273" name="The Origin of Sago Tree and Sugar Palm Tree" tags="" position="2063,691">THERE was a poor family in Donggala, Central Sulawesi. The parents had only one child, he was a son. The family was poor because the father was lazy. He did not want to work hard. The person who earned the living was the mother. Everyday she went to the jungle to collect some firewood and sold it at the market. The son always helped his mother.

The mother had repeatedly asked and advised the father to work hard. Sadly, the father always ignored her. Well, something amazing happened. Suddenly the father told the mother that he was bored with their poor lives.

&quot;I want to be rich. I will go to the jungle and open a field. I will plant vegetables and fruits. After the harvest, I will sell them. I&#39;m sure we can get lots of money.&quot;

The mother could not believe what she heard. She was absolutely happy to hear that her husband was willing to work hard for their family.

Early in the morning the father went - to the jungle. He was looking for a good place to open a field. Finally, he. found it! He looked at the place carefully. He thought.

&#39;This place is quite good. But, can I open a field here? Am I strong enough?&#39;

Instead of starting to work to open the land the father just sat under a big tree. He thought that he would be very tired to open and clear the land. It was afternoon. The husband was hungry. He went home. When he arrived, the mother welcomed him nicely.

She asked, &quot;How&#39;s the field?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;s OK&quot; answered the father shortly. The wife did not continue to ask. She thought his husband was too tired to work. Well,.she did not know that her husband spent the whole morning until afternoon just sitting under a bi[ tree.

On the following day, the father again went back to the jungle. Sadly, he did not work to clear the land, but he just sat under the big tree.

&quot;What if I&#39;m tired later?&quot; that&#39;s what the father always thought.

Days passed by and every time the wife asked her husband about the field, he always answered, &quot;It&#39;s OK.&quot;

The wife was so curious, she wanted to know how the field was. bo she secretly went to the jungle. She followed her husband. The woman saw her husband sitting under a big tree.

She asked, &quot;Where is the field?&quot;

The husband was so mad when his wife followed and asked him about the field. He said bad things to her! The man left his wife in the jungle and went home. The woman was crying. She could not control her emotion. She was extremely sad. She walked and when she found a small pond she slowly put her feet in the water.

At home, the man felt guilty. Together with his son, they went to the jungle. They found the woman standing at the pond. Strangely, the woman had turned into a sago tree. The man was screaming. He apologized, but it was too late! The son also felt very sad. He ran and hugged his mother. The son also slowly changed into a sago tree. The man then ran and jumped to the pond. When the water touched his feet, he slowly became a sugar palm tree.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="274" name="The Magic Mirror" tags="" position="1805,440">THERE was an old king. He had three sons from his concubine. The queen had long been gone. No one knew where she went. The king was not physically healthy. His old age had made him unable to work well. He got sick easily.

The king felt it was time for him to step down and chose the new king. The kingdom had a unique tradition. Unlike other kingdoms, the oldest child of the king would not automatically become a new king. So, how did they get the new king? The king had a magic mirror. When someone saw his face in the mirror, the mirror could show his true and real personality.

The king spoke to his three sons.-&quot;It&#39;s time for us to have a new king. I will step down soon, my children. So, please prepare yourselves. Tomorrow I will present the magic mirror and I want the three of you to look at your faces in the mirror. Remember, the mirror is able to show your real personality.&quot; The three sons were happy. Well, they had been waiting for this moment. They prepared themselves. They cut their hair and wore their best clothes.

On the following day, the three sons were standing in front of the king. Their mother, the king&#39;s concubine, was also there. She was very happy that one of her sons would become the new king.

The king asked his first son to come forward and see his face in the mirror. He was handsome and smiled nicely. He walked confidently. When he saw his face in the mirror, the king was surprised. The mirror reflected a face with horns! The oldest son was so ashamed.

The second son came forward. He was also handsome. However when he saw his face in the mirror, there was a reflection of his face with long and sharp teeth!

Then it was time for the third son. He was also handsome. Sadly, the mirror did not show his handsome face. Instead, there was a reflection of his face with his red eyes. He looked
so scary! The king was so disappointed.

He realized that his three sons had bad personalities that he did not know. However the king felt relief. If one of his sons became a new king, the kingdom would be in trouble. It was because the king had bad personalities.

The king had an idea. He invited his people and asked them to see their faces in the mirror. If the mirror showed a reflection of a person with handsome face, the man would become the new king.

Many men were so eager when they heard the king&#39;s invitation. One by one, men came to the palace. Sadly, the mirror always.showed them their bad sides.

An old and ugly woman came with her son. He was also ugly. People were laughing at them. They said that the mirror would show the man his uglier face.

The old woman and her son did not care at all. The ugly man saw his face in the mirror. The king was surprised! The mirror showed a very handsome man. The king was so happy. He finally found a new king.

The king asked, &quot;Who are you?&quot;

The man did not answer. He let his mother answer the king&#39;s question.

&quot;Your Majesty, don&#39;t you recognize me? I&#39;m your wife and he is your son. The concubine asked a witch to me. I became very ugly and I had to leave this palace because I did not want to disappoint you. I was pregnant when I left the palace. The spell can be broken when our son see his face in the magic mirror.&quot;

Amazingly, the old woman and her son slowly changed. She was still old but looked beautiful and her son became very handsome.

The king was so surprised when he saw his long lost wife. He thought his wife had died. He immediately asked his soldiers to put the concubine in the jail. He was angry at her! However he was grateful that he finally found his wife and his son became the new king.</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="276" name="The Legend of Bagga Stone" tags="" position="1930,568">ONCE upon a time in Tolitoli, Central Sulawesi, lived a man with his son in a hut.
The man’s name was Intobu and his son’s name was Impalak. Intobu’s wife passed away when Impalak was a baby.

Impalak was a diligent and obedient son. Intobu and Impalak were fishermen and they were poor. They did not have a big ship to go fishing. They only used a small sampan. They really wanted to have a big ship so they could have a lot of fish. The local people there named the big ship as bagga.

Impalak wanted to be rich. He asked permission from his father to leave him to find better life. Though it was very difficult, his father let him go. Impalak promised to his father that he would come back after he was rich.

Impalak went to a port. He saw a bagga or a sailboat. He came to the owner and said, “May I join you to sail in your bagga? I will work hard, Sir,” said Impalak.

The owner agreed. He let Impalak join his bagga. Impalak was happy. His dream to be a rich man would soon come true.

Impalak worked very hard. The bagga’s owner was very happy with him. Impalak was also skillful in fishing. After Impalak joined, they always got a lot of fish.

The bagga’s owner planned to ask Impalak to marry his daughter. So when they arrived in the bagga’s owner place, they held a wedding. Impalak’s dream really came true. He was a rich man and he had a big bagga!

Several years had passed, but Impalak never returned home. Sadly he already forgot his promise to his father.

In the mean time, Impalak’s father, Intobu, always thought of his son. Everyday he went to the port. Whenever a bagga came, he always looked for him. But he never found his son.

One day Impalak’s wife asked Impalak to sail in his bagga. Stormed attacked and it accidentally arrived in Impalak’s hometown.

Intobu saw a big bagga. He felt that Impalak was inside the bagga. And he was right! Impalak was there!

“Impalak? Impalak?“ said his father.

“I’m your father!”

“Who is that old man?” asked Impalak’s wife.

“I don’t know. Maybe he is just an old crazy man,” said Impalak.

Actually he recognized his father. But he was ashamed with his wife.

“Go away, you crazy man! You are not my father!” said Impalak.

“Impalak! Wait for me!” Intobu rowed his sampan. He wanted to meet his son.

However, Impalak asked his crew to leave. They left Intobu.

Intobu was very sad. He knew Impalak had already forgotten him. He prayed to God to punish him.

Again storm attacked Impalak’s bagga. This time it was very hard. Finally the bagga was stranded. Slowly the bagga turned into a big stone. Until now the stone is still in Tolitoli, Central Sulawesi. People named the stone as Bagga Stone.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="277" name="The stupid Dog" tags="" position="2186,566">DEER have horns, right? But a long time ago, the deer did not have horns. Instead, dogs had horns. How did the deer get the horns? Here is the story.

It was a very hot day. A couple of deer went to a river to drink. They were husband and wife. After arriving at the lake, they immediately drank some water. Suddenly, the wife saw an animal coming.

“My husband, who is he? Wow! He is very handsome with his horns,” said the female deer.

“Oh, that’s my friend. He is a dog. By the way, did you say he was more handsome than me?” asked the male deer. He was jealous.

“Of course not, you are still more handsome than he is. But I have to admit that his horns are beautiful. If you have those horns, I think you will look very attractive.”

“Ok, then, I have an idea how to take the horns from the dog. Just wait here.”

“Hi, how are you?” asked the stag to the dog.

“I’m just fine,” answered the dog. “How about you?”

“Not really good. You see my wife over there? He thinks that I cannot run fast like other male deer. Do you mind if we have a running match? I really want to practice,” said the stag.

“Don’t worry, my friend. Let’s have the running match now.”

After that, the running match began. The stag won. Then, he tried to cheer the dog up.

“Well, don’t be sad. You cannot run fast because you have your horns on your head. What if you let me wear the horns,” asked the stag.

“OK, but please wear the horns carefully. I don’t want them to be broken.”

“Don’t worry. I will be very careful,” replied the stag.

And then he immediately put the horns on his head.

“Wow! My wife is right. I really look great with these horns,” said the stag to himself.

Then, they started the running match again. The male deer ran as fast as he could. He ran very fast and did not stop. He was trying to steal the dog’s horns.

“Hey come back! Bring back my horns!” the dog was very angry.

Until now, dogs always try to catch deer. The dogs want to get their horns back.</tw-passagedata>

He wanted to keep it as a pet. At home, La Moelu told his mother about the attractive fish. She also liked the fish.

&quot;Put the fish inside the glass, Son. I think the glass is big enough for this small fish.&quot;

La Moelu did it. Amazingly, the fish grew bigger. The glass was not big enough for him. La Moelu then put the fish inside the bowl. Again, the fish grew bigger and it was not enough for the fish.

&quot;All right, I will make a pond for you.&quot;

La Moelu dig the land and made a fish pond. When it was ready, La Moelu put the fish inside the pond. What happened next was very surprising. The fish grew very big and the pond was not enough for him!

&quot;What should I do, Mother?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s put the fish to the sea. Maybe he will stop growing,&quot; said the mother.

La Moelu agreed. He brought the fish to the sea. Before he released the fish to the sea, he said,

&quot;I don&#39;t want to say goodbye to you. We will meet again. I will name you Jinnande Teremombonga. Every time I call out your name, you go to the beach. I will feed you then,&quot; said La Moelu to the fish.

La Moelu put the fish to the sea. Did the fish grow bigger? Yes, he did! The fish grew as a giant fish. On the following day, La Moelu went to the beach. He called out the fish name, &quot;Jinnande Teremombonga! Jinnande Teremombonga!&quot;

Not long after that the fish appeared and swam approach Moelu. He gave some food to the fish. He was happy. La Moelu did not know that three men were watching. Who were they? They were La Moelu&#39;s neighbors. They were interested in the giant fish.

&quot;Let&#39;s catch the fish tomorrow. You know the fish name, right? You call out the fish name and after that I will throw a spear. After the fish is dead, we can cook and eat for the whole family,&quot; said one man.

Yes, three of them were brothers. They wanted to kill the fish and cook for their family. Early in the morning, the three men went to the sea. One of them called out the fish&#39;s name.

When the giant fish appeared, one man threw a spear. It hit the fish! The fish was bleeding terribly and slowly it died. The three men brought the fish home. Meanwhile, La Moelu went to the sea. He called out the fish&#39;s name several times, but the fish did not appear. La Moelu was sad. He went home.

He passed his neighbor&#39;s house. He saw they were having a party. Yes, they were eating the giant fish. They invited La Moelu to join them. He accepted their offer.

When La Moelu saw the fish, he was shocked. He recognized his fish. He was so sad that he could not say anything. Before he left the house, he grabbed one fish bone. He wanted to bury the fish properly.

La Moelu buried the fish bone. On the following day, a small tree grew. The tree was beautiful. The leaves and the branches were gold! La Moelu picked the leaves and branches. He wanted to sell them. Amazingly, there grew another leaves and branches. La Moelu and his mother had lots of money! Since then La Moelu and his mother became very rich. They were very happy.</tw-passagedata>

Niining Kubaea was very lonely. She did not have anyone she could talk to. To keep her busy, she often knitted dress.

One day, a man came to her house. He looked so scary, He brought a basket.

&quot;What can I do, Sir?&quot; said Niining Kubaea nervously.

She thought the man would do something bad to her.

&quot;I want to offer you a baby.&quot;

He pointed to the basket.

&quot;A baby?&quot; asked Niining Kubaea.

&quot;Yes, I have a baby here. And I want to sell her to you,&quot; replied the man.

Niining Kubaea took a look at the basket. She saw a cute baby girl sleeping soundly. She fell in love with the baby.

She said, &quot;Yes, I want to buy her.&quot;

She immediately opened her drawer where she kept her money. It was her saving.

The man accepted the money and gave her the baby. Niining Kubaea was very happy. She loved the baby and took care of her very well. She was not lonely anymore.

Niining Kubaea&#39;s daughter grew as a very beautiful daughter. She became very famous. People often talked about her, mostly men. They fell in love with her.

Niining Kubaea was very protective to her daughter. She often put some powder on her daughter&#39;s face. She wanted to cover her beauty. Well, unfortunately it did not work. people still could see how beautiful she was.

More and more people heard about how beautiful Niining Kubaea&#39;s daughter was. The king also heard that and he did not like it. He had a son and a daughter.

The king&#39;s daughter was also beautiful. The king often said that she was the most beautiful girl in the kingdom. He would kill any girl who was more beautiful than his daughter!

The king ordered his soldiers to go to Niining Kubaea&#39;s house. They had to bring Niining Kubaeat daughter to the palace. Niining Kubaea tried to stop them. Sadly, they were too strong.

The king ordered the soldiers to hang Niining Kubaea&#39;s daughter. The prince tried to stop it. He said, &quot;Father.. please don&#39;t do that. She is innocent.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care! I just want my daughter to be the most beautiful girl here!&quot; said the king.

The soldiers brought her to the pole. They put a rope along the girl&#39;s neck. Niining Kubaea was there. She cried terribly. She tried to save her beloved daughter, but the soldiers held her. She was helpless.

&#39;When the soldiers were ready to hang her, suddenly the prince ran very fast and jumped towards her. They both fell down on the ground. Accidentally, he saw a birthmark on her hand.

He said, &quot;Father.. look! She has birthmark just like my sister does!&quot;

The king immediately approached the girl. It was true! She had the same birthmark as his
daughter had.

The king walked to Niining Kulaea.

He asked, &quot;Who is she? Is she your biological daughter?&quot;

Niining Kubaea said, &quot;No, Your Majesty. She is not my biological daughter. She also knows that.&quot;

Then Niining Kubaea explained the king how she met her daughter.

The king was shocked when he heard Niining Kubaea&#39;s story.

He said, &quot;I have twin daughters. However, when they were babies one of them was kidnapped. Both of my babies were very cute and they had the same birthmark on her hand. I&#39;m sure your daughter is my lost daughter.&quot;

The king then talked to Niining Kubaea&#39;s daughter.

&quot;My daughter, please forgive me. I did not know who you were. Niining Kubaea, please also forgive me....&quot;

They all were very happy, the family finally reunited. Since then, Niining Kubaea and her daughter lived in the palace. They lived happily ever after. </tw-passagedata>

Recently, the villagers had a terrible rumor. They heard that there was a giant eagle coming to their village. The eagle was so big that it could grab a cow with its giant claws.

The villagers were restless. They hoped the rumor was not true. Sadly, they were wrong. The giant eagle was indeed coming. It was flying above the village and looking for something to eat.

The villagers were hiding inside their houses. The parents asked their children to immediately go home and they also saved their cattle inside the cages.

Sadly, one cow was left in the field. The eagle saw the cow. It flew very fast then grabbed the cow with its giant claws. The eagle flew away and brought the cow!

The villagers were extremely shocked! They had never seen such horrible thing like that. They soon had a meeting to find the solution.

&quot;We have to kill the eagle. Sooner or later the eagle will eat our cattle. And if there is no cattle left, the eagle will eat us!&quot; screamed one villager.

&quot;He&#39;s right! We have to kill the eagle. I think I know the solution. I heard there is a wise man who is very small. He knows all solutions to any problem. Let&#39;s meet him,&quot; said another villager.

Some villagers went to another village. It was quite far and they had to spend days to meet the wise man. When they finally met the wise man, they told him about the giant eagle and asked him how to kill it.

The wise man said, &quot;It&#39;s easy. just find one man who is willing to be the bait. Surround the man&#39;s body with sharp bamboos. Don&#39;t forget to cover the bamboos with deadly poison. When the eagle tries to catch the man, the bamboos will stab the eagle&#39;s body.&quot;

The villagers understood what the wise man said. They soon went back home and asked one man who was willing to be the bait.

Unfortunately, no one wanted to be the bait. The head of the village even promised to give lots of money to a man who was willing to be the bait.

Finally a poor man took the challenge. He wanted to use the money to help his poor parents. The man&#39;s name was Tasahea.

The head of the village immediately asked the villagers to prepare the sharp bamboos. They also put the bamboos with some deadly poison. After that they attached the bamboos around Tasahea&#39;s body.

Later, Tasahea was standing on the open field. The villagers were hiding inside their house. All the cattle were also kept safely in the cages.

Not long after that, they heard the eagle coming. The eagle saw Tasahea. It flew closer then tried to grab Tasahea.

But before the claws grabbed Tasahea&#39;s body, the bamboos stabbed the eagle&#39;s body. The eagle was screaming in pain. Tasahea saw a good opportunity to kill the eagle. He took one big spear that he had prepared earlier, then threw it against the eagle&#39;s body.

The spear hit the eagle! The eagle was still able to fly away. However it was bleeding badly and it finally landed on the top of a big mountain, The eagle lost too much blood. The eagle finally died.

It was time to harvest the sugarcane. He was so happy. Early in the morning, he left his house and went to the ﬁeld. However, he was so surprised when he arrived at the ﬁeld. The ﬁeld was in a mess. It seemed that some people had already taken his sugarcane. He was so upset.
He wanted to ﬁnd the thief! He heard some people were laughing.

He heard, “Hmmm this sugarcane is so yummy!”

“Aha!” said Oheo.

“The thieves are still here. I’m going to catch them!”

Oheo tried not to make sounds. However, he could not ﬁnd them. And when he looked upward, he saw seven beautiful angels ﬂy at the sky. They had the sugarcane! Those angels flew to the river. They wanted to take a bath. Oheo followed them.

Oheo was not angry anymore. Instead, he was so happy. He fell in love and wanted to marry one of the angels. Secretly, he took one of the angels’ shawls. And of course, after ﬁnished taking a bath, one angel could not ﬂy to the sky.

Oheo then showed up. He pretended that he was willing to help her.

“My name is Oheo. Why do you look so sad?”

“My name is Princess Anawai. I’m an angel. I just lost my shawl. Without it, I cannot ﬂy back to my home. I live in a palace in the sky,” said the angel.

“Why don’t you stay at my home while I’m looking for it,” said Oheo.

Princess Anawai agreed to stay at his house. She did not know that Oheo was hiding her shawl. Later, Oheo asked her to marry him.

Princess Anawai agreed but Oheo had to promise one thing. Oheo had to clean and wash their children, if they defecated. Oheo agreed. He was really in love with her. Princess Anawai was so beautiful. He also thought that washing the child is not difﬁcult thing to do. It was a year after they got married and they had one child. As promised, Oheo always washed the child after the child defecated.

So, she washed the child. And then accidentally, she found her shawl. It was kept in the bathroom.

She wore her shawl and ﬂew to the sky. Oheo tried to impede her but Princess Anawai had already made up her mind. She was so disappointed.

Oheo was so sorry. He blamed himself for not being able to keep the promise. He really loved his wife. He tried very hard to fly to the sky.

Finally, he got help. A tree was willing to help him. Oheo and his child climbed the tree.
Slowly, the tree is getting higher and higher. And soon, Oheo was able to go to the palace in the sky.

When he arrived, the king was angry. “You already made my daughter sad. If you want to ﬁnd her, go to that dark room. If you can ﬁnd her, you can take her back to your home. But if you cannot ﬁnd her, I will put you in the jail.”

Oheo was confused. He did not know how to ﬁnd her wife in the very dark room. Suddenly, a ﬁrefly came to him. He was willing to help Oheo.

With the help of ﬁreﬂy, the room was no longer dark. Therefore, he could ﬁnd her wife easily. After he found her, Oheo asked her to forgive him. He promised to be a better husband.
Later, they went back to their home on earth.</tw-passagedata>

However, he was too weak to go there. He was waiting for an animal to help him. His wish came true. A buffalo was passing by. He asked the buffalo to helped him.

&quot;I want to go to the river. But I am too weak. May I jump on your back and take me to the river?&quot; asked the crocodile.

&quot;Certainly, Mr Crocodile. I&#39;m glad to help you,&quot; said the Buffalo.

Soon the crocodile was on top of the buffalo&#39;s back. And when they arrived at the river side, the buffalo asked the crocodile to get off.

A mouse deer saw their argument. He was standing at the river side. He wanted to know what happened.

&quot;Hey, what are you arguing about?&quot; asked the mouse deer.

&quot;I already helped Mr. Crocodile, but now he wants to eat me.&quot;

The mouse deer knew that the crocodile was a mean animal. He wanted to help the buffalo.

&quot;What? I cannot hear you. Both of you are too far from me. Come closer to the ground.

Slowly, the buffalo moved his body. The crocodile was still biting his leg. And when they were on the ground, the mouse deer whispered to the buffalo&#39;s ear.

The buffalo immediately kicked the crocodile with his other leg. The crocodile was in pain. He opened his mouth. The buffalo was free. Soon the buffalo and the mouse deer ran fast to save their lives.

&quot;Wait for my revenge mouse deer. I will eat you alive!&quot; the crocodile was angry.

Several days later, the crocodile met the mouse deer.

&quot;Aha! I will eat you now!&quot;

&quot;No, wait! Do you know what I&#39;m doing here?&quot; asked the mouse deer.

He continued, &quot;Do you see that big and shining rope over there? Well, it&#39;s not a rope. It&#39;s a magic belt. The god of the jungle asked me to guard it.&quot;

&quot;Really? What kind of magic does this belt have?&quot; asked the crocodile.

&quot;Anyone who wears the belt will have great power,&quot; explained the mouse deer.

The crocodile wanted to have great power. However, he did not know that the belt was actually a big snake. And the snake was sleeping.

The old woman continued to meet the third, fourth, and fifth princess. Unfortunately they all rejected her proposal. The old woman did not give up. She still had one last hope. It was the youngest princess.

The old woman talked to the youngest princess and also told her that his grandson was kind and helpful. Surprisingly the youngest princess accepted the proposal. All her sisters mocked her. They said that she would marry a man who looked like an egg.

The king set a wedding party. The old woman came with La Onto-ontolu. People were so amazed to see how handsome he was. The youngest princess&#39; sisters were so jealous!

They had a bad plan. They wanted to kill La Onto-ontolu by drowning him in the sea. So after the party was over, the sisters asked the youngest princess and her husband to go fishing in the sea.

When they arrived, the sisters dropped the youngest princess ring to the sea. The princess was sad, La Onto-ontolu immediately jumped and dove to find the ring. Seeing that, the sisters directly rowed and left him!

The youngest sister was crying! She completely had no idea why her sisters were so mean to him. She talked to the king, however afher sisters said that La Onto-ontolu had an accident and it was not their mistake.

The queen was extremely jealous. She had a bad plan. She exchanged the babies with three puppies, two males and one female. When the King returned from hunting, he was very angry! He thought the girl was a liar and as a punisnment, she was sent to the jail.

How about the babies? Well, the Queen asked one soldier to kill them. However, the soldier did not have the heart. He felt very sorry for the babies so he gave them to an old woman. He told her the truth about the babies.

Who was the old woman? Well, apparently she was a witch, but a good witch. She promised the soldier that she would take care of the babies.

Times flew and the babies became teenagers. One day, the old, woman heard that the King held a cockfight competition and the first prize was gold. The old woman thought it was a good time for the children to go to the palace.

&quot;But we don&#39;t have a cock, Mother,&quot; said the oldest child.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I will find a cock for you,&quot; replied the old woman. With her supernatural power, she changed a cat into a cock.

&quot;Bring this cock. Later when you win, tell the king that you dgn&#39;t want gold as the prize. TelI the king that as the prize you want the king to free the woman in the jail. Listen, she is your real mother,&quot; explained the old woman sadly.

The three children could not believe what they heard. Then the old woman told them the truth. After that the three kids went to the palace to challenge the king&#39;s cock.

Well, the king&#39;s cock could not fight the kids&#39; cock. In just a minute, the kids&#39; cock became the winner.

The King was fair so he gave them the gold. But the kids refused the gold instead they asked the
king to free a woman in the jail.

&quot;Why?&quot; asked the King.

&quot;She is our mother,&quot; said the kids.

The king did not believe them. Suddenly the old woman and the soldier appeared. They told the king about the Queen&#39;s bad action.

The King was terribly angry! He immediately freed the woman and he apologized to the kids and their mother. The king also punished the Queen. She was sent to the jail! </tw-passagedata>

After the bird was healed, it did not fly away. It was always flying, near Ambo Upe. He loved the bird and always fed it. Slowly, the bird was getting bigger. The feathers were beautiful and it could talk. Yes, the,bird was a parrot!

One day, while Ambo Upe was herding the cows, two men were approaching him. They looked so scary.

One of the men asked, &quot;Hey, Kid! What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m herding my cows,&quot; said Ambo Upe nervously.

&quot;Where are your cows?&quot; asked the &#39;other man.

&quot;Over there,&quot; Ambo Upe was pointing at his cows.

&quot;Hahaha... Today is our lucky day!&quot; said one man.

&quot;Let&#39;s tie him now!&quot;

The two men tied Ambo Upe and attached him to a big tree. Ambo Upe was screaming for help.

&quot;HeIp.... Please, help me!&quot; screamed Am.bo Upe.

&quot;It&#39;s useless! No one can hear you here!&quot; yelled one man.

The parrot saw the incident. The bird flew and carefully followed the thieves. They went to a cave and kept the cows inside the cave. Afier that, the parrot flew back to Ambo upe&#39;s house. The bird was screaming and talking nervously.

The parrot said, &quot;Thieves! Ambo Upe... Ambo upe....&quot;

Ambo Upe&#39;s father did not understand what the bird was talking about. Somehow he felt something bad just happened. The bird flew and Ambo Upe&#39;s father followed the bird.

The father was shocked when he found his beloved son was tied. He immediately released him. Ambo Upe hugged his father. He was crying. He told him about two men who stole their cows.

The parrot suddenly said, &quot;The cave... the cave....&quot; The bird flew and asked them to follow him.

The father understood what the parrot meant. However, he did not want to follow the bird.

He said, &quot;We must get some help. We cannot catch the two thieves alone. We must ask other people to help us.&quot;

Ambo Upe and his father went back to their house. The father talked to the villagers about the thieves. They were angry when they heard about the incident. They wanted to catch the . thieves. Soon, they all followed the parrot.

Not long after that, they arrived at the cave. The villagers were hiding behind the bushes. Meanwhile, Arnbo Upe&#39;s father was standing in front of the cave. He yelled. &quot;Hey thieves! Bring back my cows!&quot;

The thieves heard the yelling. They came out and stood in front of the cave. They were laughing at Ambo Upe&#39;s father.

&quot;Hahaha... You are alone! How dare you come here!&quot; said one thief.

&quot;I&#39;m not alone,&quot; said Ambo Upe&#39;s father.

Later, all the villagers were running and surrounding the thieves!

The thieves were completely shocked! They did not,know that there were lots of villagers cornering them. The thieves gave up!

The princess was on the top of the mountain. She was sitting helplessly. She was waiting for any men to come and save her. Sadly, no one came. It seemed that men were scared with the eagle.

The eagle came! The princess closed her eyes. She did not have any courage to look at the eagle. When the eagle was about to grab her, a man came! He used his sword to attack the eagle. The eagle fought back! He used his claws to attack the man. The man was wounded. Then he stabbed the eagle! The eagle was dead!

&quot;Look at all the guests, My Child. Can you recognize the man who helped you?&quot; asked the king.

&quot;I still remember his face, Father. I gave him my scarf. I&#39;m sure he will bring it and return it to me,&quot; replied the princess.

After a while, the man came. He brought the princess&#39;scarf!

&quot;Is he the man who killed the eagle?&quot; asked the king to the princess.

&quot;Yes, he is,&quot; said the princess, She was so happy that she could meet him again. She was also happy that the man was very handsome. She fell in love with him.

&quot;Hey, girl I want to get married. Do you want to be my wife?&quot;

The girl was angry! She thought La Tongko-Tongko was mocking her. She threw the potatoes at him. La Tongko-Tongko ran away !

At home, La Tongko-Tongko told his mother about the girl he met today.

&quot;Oh, you are so stupid La Tongko-Tongko. You canrrot ask a girl io get married like that. You and the girl have to love each other, then you can get married,&quot; explained his mother.

<tw-passagedata pid="295" name="La Dana and His Buffalo" tags="" position="813,571">IN Toraja, South Sulawesi, lived a young man. His name was La Dana. Everybody knew him. He was known for his clever ideas. He always tricked bad people. That’s why the villagers loved him.

In Toraja, there was always a ceremony when someone passed away. In the ceremony, the guests could get buffalo meat from the host of the ceremony. La Dana went to the ceremony. Before he went home, the host gave him buffalo legs.

On the way home, La Dana met Pak Kikir. He brought the whole body parts of the buffalo except the legs. Pak Kikir was a very stingy man. Nobody liked him. La Dana then had an idea to trick him.

“Pak Kikir, you have all parts of the buffalo except the legs. And I only have the legs. Why don’t we put them together and gave them back to the host. We ask him to exchange it with a living buffalo. We raise the buffalo until it is big. Do you agree?”

“That is a good idea. Let’s meet the host,” said Pak Kikir.

Together they went back to the ceremony. The host agreed with one condition. He would exchange with a young buffalo.

After they got the young buffalo, Pak Kikir and La Dana went home.

“La Dana, let me raise the buffalo,” said Pak Kikir.

He wanted to raise it by himself because he was afraid that La Dana would steal it.

“I agree, but let me visit the buffalo everyday,” said La Dana.

He was happy, his idea was running well so far. On the following day, La Dana came to Pak Kikir’s house.

“Hey! Look! The buffalo is getting fatter,” said La Dana.

“The buffalo has just been here for a day. How can you say he is getting fatter?”

“Look at the buffalo carefully. It is getting fatter. Pak Kikir, I want the legs now. They are mine, right?” said La Dana.

Pak Kikir was silent. He knew if the legs were cut, the buffalo would die.

“Don’t take the legs now. Wait for another time,” said Pak Kikir.

On the following day, La Dana again came to Pak Kikir’s house and asked for the legs. Pak Kikir said the same thing, he asked La Dana to wait.

Then La Dana came and came again. Every time he visited the buffalo, he always asked Pak Kikir to give him legs.

Finally, Pak Kikir could not hold it anymore.

“It’s enough La Dana! If you cut the legs, the buffalo would die. The buffalo is still young. We will not get a lot of meat. If you want to get the legs, here take this buffalo with you!” said Pak Kikir.

He gave the buffalo to La Dana. La Dana was happy. His plan worked! He got a living buffalo and brought it home. </tw-passagedata>

Jilumoto was amazed by their beauty. He stole one of the goddesses&#39; wing. When they finished taking a bath, they prepared to go back to heaven. However, one goddess could not fly, she lost her wing.

&quot;Oh no! Where&#39;s my wing?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Sister. I could not accompany here. We must go back to heaven.&quot;

&quot;I know... I understand that you have to go back to heaven. Please pray for me.&quot;

The rest of the goddesses flew back to heaven. Jilumoto approached the goddess who still stayed in the lake.

&quot;What&#39;s your name? Why are you crying? How can I help you?&quot; asked Jilumoto.

&quot;My name is Mbu&#39;i Bungale. I&#39;m a goddess and I lost my wing. I could not go back to heaven.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Mbu&#39;i Bungale, I will help you. You can stay with me. By the way, my name is jilumoto.&quot;

Since then, Mbu&#39;i Bungale and Jilumoto lived together. They fell in love and later they got married.

One day, Mbu&#39;i Bungale received a package from heaven. It was a golden egg. The egg was so big. Mbu&#39;i Bungale and Jilumoto were afraid that the egg was stolen. So they hid it carefully near the lake. It was the same lake that Mbu&#39;i Bungale and her sisters taking a bath.

After they hid the egg, Mbu&#39;i Bungale and Jilumoto went home. Later four men came to the lake. And while they were resting, one of the men accidentally found the egg. They were so surprised.

&quot;Wow! This must be very expensive if we sell it.&quot;

&quot;I agree, let&#39;s sell it tomorrow,&quot; said another man.

On the following day, Mbu&#39;i Bungale and Jilumoto came back to the lake. They found the men kept the golden egg.

&quot;The egg is ours,&quot; said Mbu&#39;i Bungale.

&quot;No, it belongs to us,&quot; said the men.

&quot;Let&#39;s prove it. If you can make the lake grows bigger, the egg is yours. But if you can&#39;t the egg is ours,&quot; said Mbu&#39;i Bungale.

&quot;I accept your challenge,&quot; said the men.

They started to dig the sides of the lake. They had spent hours, but the progress was so small. They gave up.

&quot;It&#39;s my turn &quot; said Mbu&#39;i Bungale.

With her power as a goddess, she could make the lake grew bigger easily. The lake was expanding. And that made the men speechless. They gave the egg to Mbu&#39;i Bungale and Jilumoto.

When Mbu&#39;i Bungale received the egg, surprisingly the egg hatched. Inside, they saw a cute baby girl. The couple were so happy. They named her Tolango Hula, which means the moon light.

When the family were about to go home, they saw some oranges floating in the lake. Jilumoto took the oranges.

Mbu&#39;i Bungale and jilumoto recognized the oranges. It was the oranges from the heaven. When they looked around, they saw some orange trees in the sides of the lake. Then Mbu&#39;i Bungale and Jilumoto named the lake as Bulalo lo limu o tutu which means the lake that was made from oranges in heaven. Stowly the name of lake then changed into Limboto Lake.</tw-passagedata>

The youngest sister was sad. She kept on searching her wings. Meanwhile, Lahilote had been watching her and then he suddenly showed up in front of her.

&quot;Why do you look so sad? What happened?&quot; asked Lahilote.

&quot;My name is Boilode Hulawa. I&#39;m an angel from heaven. I lost my wings.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry I&#39;ll help you find your wings. In the mean time, you can stay in my home until you find your wings.&quot;

Boilode Hulawa happily accepted his offer. Since then she stayed in his house. Time passed by and they began to fall in love. Later they got married and lived happily.

Lahilote had a rice barn and it was always full of rice. Lahilote was so curious why the barn was always full of rice although his wife always cooked it. So one day, while his wife was cooking, he opened the pan. He saw only one piece of rice! He was so curious! He asked his wife how it happened.

She told him that she used her magic to cook. Unfortunately, the magic was broken after he opened the pan. It meant that she had to cook normally.

While the angel was trying to get some rice in the barn, she found her wings! She was so happy!

She immediately wore her wings and flew back to the heaven. Before she left, she told all the animals and the trees not to tell her husband that she flew to the heaven. They all agreed, except rattan tree. The tree did not want to lie.

Lahilote went home. He was looking for his wife but she was nowhere to be found. He asked the animals and the trees but they did not tell him. Finally, the rattan tree told him the truth. The tree even offered him help. Lahilote could climb the tree to reach the heaven in the sky.

Lahilote climbed the tree and later he arrived in the heaven. He looked for his wife and he finally found her! Lahilote begged her to stay with him on earth. He also promised that he would not lie anymore. His wife was so touched. After all she also loved him.

She agreed to live with him on earth. Then she wore her wings to fly to the earth while Lahilote would climb down the tree.

Unfortunately the rattan tree was old. The branches were decayed and they could not hold his body. Sadly, he fell down terribly. He landed on the big stone and it had his footprints.

The stone still exists in Gorontalo and it has an image of footprints. Local people believe that the footprints belong to Lahilote!</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="301" name="The Deer and the Sea Snail" tags="" position="1676,808">A long time ago in a jungle in Aru Islands, Maluku, lived a group of deer. They were very proud of their ability in running very fast. They always stayed in different places. They challenged other animals in a running match. If the deer won the match, they took over the place and stayed there.

Not far from the jungle, there was a beautiful beach. A group of sea snail lived there. The deer heard about the beautiful beach and planned to live there. They had a plan to challenge snails in a running match.

They were very sure to win the match. Sea snails were slow in walking. “

What’s the rule?” asked the leader of the sea snails after he heard about the challenge.

“Do you see all the capes there? There are twelve capes, from here until there,” the deer leader pointed the capes.

The distance between one cape to another was very far.

“We run from the first cape until the twelfth cape. If my runner arrives first at the twelfth cape, we’re the winner. And we stay here!”

The sea snails then had a meeting. They set a strategy to win the match.

“My plan is to put the twelve of us in every cape. If their runner arrives in every cape, you shout. So, the deer will never rest and gets very tired,” said the leader.

And the day of the match finally arrived. All animals watched this unique match, the deer versus the sea snail. The runners were standing side by side.

Then, the deer ran very fast. In just a second, he already left the sea snail. After a few hours of running, he arrived at the first cape.

He shouted, “Hey? Where are you?”

“I’m here,” said the sea snail.

He was another sea snail that was hiding in the first cape. The deer was surprised. He cancelled his plan to get some rest.

He continued running. In every cape, there was always a sea snail. And the deer always cancelled his plan to get some rest.

Finally, the deer almost reached the twelfth cape but he was exhausted. He was really tired. And he gave up. He did not have any more strength to run. He fell down on the ground.

“Hooray!” said all the sea snails.

The deer were so embarrassed. They were just tricked by the clever sea snails. So the deer came back to the jungle and never returned to the beach.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="302" name="Tonamalangi" tags="" position="1801,828">TARAKANI and Wayamoto were the names of villages in Maluku. Those two villages were side by side. There was no clear border but a jungle separated Tarakani and Wayamoto.

The people in Tarakani and Wayamoto never crossed the jungle. They also never visited their neighboring village. Why? Well, because the people in the Tarakani and Wayamoto did not get along very well. They were always fighting. They hated each other!

The hatred between those two villages had been happening for a long time. It was so long that people did not remember when they started to hate each other. Interestingly, people in those villages did not know the reason why they started the quarrel.

There were two families that lived near the jungle. One family was in Tarakani and the other one was in Wayamoto.

Both of the families had one son. The parents of those two families always forbade their children to cross the jungle or to make friends with the children in the neighboring village.

The kids often asked their fathers why they could not cross the jungle to play with the kids in the neighboring village. The fathers always gave unclear answer. They just said that the kids were not allowed to do it.

Well, both of the kids were really curious. When the fathers were not at home, those two kids secretly
went to the jungle.

Accidentally, the two kids met! They introduced each other. When they knew that they were from the opponent village, the kids promised not to tell anyone about it. They also agreed to meet in the jungle to play. They were happy to have new friends!

One day, the leader of Tarakani village went to the jungle. He had been hunting the animals but unfortunately it was not a good day for him to go hunting. He kept on walking and he almost crossed the border.

Meanwhile, exactly at the same time the leader of  Wayamoto was also hunting in the jungle. He also had the same problem. He could not find any single of animal! He kept on walking and he almost crossed the border.

The two leaders did not know that they were in the same place. They were coming from the opposing areas. They carefully walked. Suddenly, they heard children talking.

The two leaders were curious. They slowly walked and tried to listen to the kids conversation.

&quot;I&#39;m so sad with this problem. Actually I want to go to your village and play with other kids there,&quot; said one kid.

&quot;Me, too. But my father never let me go to your village. He can never explain it to me. I&#39;m so sad why our parents behave like that,&quot; said the other child.

The leaders were touched. They did not know that the problems between the two villages had made the kids suffer. They slowly approached the kids.

The two leaders were finally face-to-face! They were shocked! They were speechless, not knowing what to do.

The kids said, &quot;Why the two of you are quiet, Sirs? Please talk.&quot;

The leaders smiled. They shook hand and began to talk about how to make peace between the two villages.

Peace finally happened! The people in those two villages were very happy. To commemorate their historical moment, they put a big stone in the border of the villages. That big stone was named Tonamalangi which means &#39;the Border&#39;.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="303" name="Kuna the Liar" tags="" position="1926,828">THERE was a young man named Kuna. He was handsome and very clever. Sadly, he often lied and tricked people. His parents had often advised him to be a good man. Unfortunately, he never listened to them.

It was a hot day. Kuna was hungry. He saw an old woman selling bananas. He wanted to eat the bananas but he did not want to pay for them. So, what did he do? He tricked the old woman.

He said, &quot;My sister is pregnant. She really wants to eat bananas and she asked me to buy some, sadly I don&#39;t have enough money.&quot;

Kuna was in tears when he was taking to the old woman and that made her feel so sorry.

&quot;Here, take these bananas and give them to your sister. Don&#39;t worry you don&#39;t have to pay anything,&quot; said the old woman.

Kuna accepted the bananas happily. After he was quite far from the old woman, he immediately ate the bananas. He was also laughing.

&quot;Ha ha ha.... She is so stupid,&quot; he said.

Later he met some of his friends. They were talking about the princess. She was so beautjful. They heard that the king had asked her to get married. The problem was the princess had not found the right man yet.

&quot;It will be wonderful if I can marry her,&quot; said one man.

&quot;Dream on... The king only wants a prince to marry his daughter,&quot; said another man.

Kuna heard their conversation. He had a plan.

On the following day, he bought expensive clothes. Later he wore them. When he met his friends, he asked them to hit him badly.

&quot;Why?&quot; they asked.

&quot;Just hit me. Don&#39;t worry I won&#39;t hit you back,&quot; said Kuna,

Though they did not understand, they hit Kuna. After that he walked to the palace. The soldiers helped him.

&quot;What happened?&quot; they asked.

&quot;I&#39;m a princel was just robbed,&quot; Kuna lied.

The soldiers believed him then they brought him to the king.

He asked, &quot;Who are you.&quot;

&quot;I&quot;m a prince, Your Majesty. I was hunting when the robbers attacked me. My soldiers are dead. I can save my life after I killed them,&quot; said Kuna convincingly.

Yes, Kuna was so good at lying and that made the King believed to anything he said!

&quot;Hmm.... Okay, I will let you stay here in my palace until your wound is healed,&quot; said the King.

&quot;Thank you, Your Majesty-&quot; said Kuna. He was happy, part of his plan worked well.

Kuna made good use of his stay in the palace. He often talked to the King and tried to convince him that he was the right man forhis daughter. Slowly, the king started to like him. Kuna was so good at talking that finally the king liked him.

The king asked his daughter to marry Kuna. The princess refused her father&#39;s request. Secretly, the princess asked one soldier to investigate who Kuna was. The soldier reported to the princess that Kuna was just a villager and he was also known as a liar.

The princess asked the soldier to bring Kuna&#39;s friends to the King. The friends then told the King about Kuna and how they hit Kuna.

The king was angry! He would punish Kuna by hanging to death! Kuna was crying, he said that he regretted his bad behavior and asked the king to give him a second chance. Kuna promised to behave well. The king was wise. He forgave Kuna but he would hang Kuna if he ever lied again. Since then, Kuna never lied and became a good man.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="304" name="Bulu Pamali" tags="" position="2053,821">ONCE upon a time, there was a poor man named Yongker. He was helpful and kind. People liked him because anytime people needed help, Yongker was always
ready.

To earn his life, Yongker sold firewood. To get the woods, he went to the jungle. After that, he sold to people who needed them.

It was a bright day. Yongker went to the jungle. He looked around to find good woods. However, he still could not find any of them.

It was almost dark, Yongker wanted to stay and flnd a good place to sleep. He thought he would go home in the morning.

Yongker found a comfortable place. It looked like that someone had already cleared and made the place as a good place to rest.

Yongker was so happy. He never saw a good place to rest like that.

It was morning and Yongker was still sleeping. Suddenly an old man woke him up.

&quot;Hey! Wake up! This is my place! What are you doing here? Who are&#39;you?!&quot; yelled the old man.

Yongkerwas so shocked! He was confused. At first, he forgot where he was. Then he remembered that he was sleeping in the jungle.

&quot;Answer me! Who are you and what are you doing here in my place?!&quot; yelled the old man. He was angry because Yongker did not respond him.

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry Sir. Please forgive me. My name is Yongker. I was lost last night,&quot; Yongker looked down. He showed how sorry he was.

&quot;What are you doing here in this jungle?&quot; asked the old man.

&#39;t collect some firewood then sell them, Sir.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you have any other jobs?&quot;

&quot;No, Sir... This is my only job,&quot; said Yongker.

The old man felt sorry to Yongker. He was touched to see Yongker&#39;s spirit to live. He wanted to give him a present.

&quot;Yongker, I know you are a good man. I want to give you a great power. With the power, you &#39;will not feel any pain. No one can hurt you. Use the power wisely,&quot; said the old man.

Then h.e went to some bamboo trees. He picked one bamboo then stabbed Yongker. Surprisingly, Yongker did not feel any pain. Instead, he felt very strong and healthy.

&quot;Thank you, Sir,&quot; said Yongker.

However, the old man was gone.

&quot;Sir... Where are you?&quot; Yongker looked around but he could not find the old man.

Amazingly, the bamboo trees were also gone. Yongker went home.

On the way home, he met some robbers. They wanted to rob him.

&quot;I don&#39;t have anything,&quot; said Yongker.

Unfortunately, the robbers did not believe him. They attacked him. One robber stabbed Yongker. Amazingly Yongker was fine. He did not feel any pain. The robbers were scared, They all ran away.

All villagers were happy when they knew that Yongker had become a very strong man. Yorgker
had already promised them that he would use his power only for good things.

People then named the place where Yongker met the old man as Bulu Pamali. Bulu means &#39;bamboo&#39;and Pamali means &#39;gone mysteriously&#39;.</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="306" name="The Bronze Crocodile" tags="" position="563,571">A long time ago, in Gulf Baguala, Maluku, there lived a giant crocodile. The crocodile was very big. Its tail was long and its teeth were sharp.

The crocodile looked so scary. The skin color was bronze and it made anyone and any animals that just saw the crocodile would be scared to death. The.crocodile was named bronze crocodile.

Though the crocodile looked so scary all animals in the gulf lovedhimvery much. Why? How could this happen? Why all ttle animals loved the crocodile? WelI it was because the crocodile protected them. Yes, the bronze crocodile was their king. All the animals in the gulf lived happily and peacefirlly. It was a beautiful day while a crab looked so worried.

&quot;Hey, what&#39;s the matter with you?&quot; asked a fish.

&quot;I... I... I...&quot; the crab was unable to talk.

&quot;Calm down, relax. Then tell me what happened.&quot;

&quot;There is a big snake coming to our gulf. He is trying to eat me. Luckily I was able to escape,&quot; said the crab.

In the middle of their conversation, came an octopus.

&quot;Gosh... you are not going to believe what just happened to me,&quot; said the octopus.

&quot;Why? What&#39;s going on?&quot; asked the fish.

&quot;A big snake just attacked me. He almost ate me. I escaped,&quot; said the octopus nervously.

&quot;We cannot let this happen. We have to report it to our king,&quot; said the fish.

&quot;I agree! Let&#39;s meet our kingl&quot; said the octopus.

The three of them immediately went to see their king, the bronze crocodile. In just a minute, they arived at the bronze crocodile&#39;s place,

&quot;Your Majesty, we have a bad news! A big snake is coming to our place. He is disturbing us and trying to eat us!&quot; said the crab.

He continued,

&quot;Where is he? Where can I find him?&quot;

&quot;I will show you where he is, Your Majesty. Please follow me,&quot; said the octopus.

The crocodile bravely followed the octopus. He was so angry! He hated that his place was disturbed.

&quot;Over there, Your Majesty! That&#39;s the snake that tried to eat me,&quot; said the octopus. He pointed at one big snake.

&quot;Thank you, now you can go home,&quot; said the bronze crocodile.

&quot;Hey, you! What are you doing here?&quot; asked the bronze crocodile to the snake angrily.

&quot;I&#39;m hungry I want to eat,&quot; said the snake arrogantly.

&quot;You cannot do it here! You are not welcomed! Go awayl&quot; asked the crocodlle.

&quot;Ha ha ha... I will not go. I love this place and I will stay herel:&#39;

&quot;Then I have to fight you,&quot; said the crocodile.

The fight between the bronze crocodile and the snake was unstoppable. The fight was very terrible.

Luckily the bronze crocodile was much stronger than the snake. Soon, the snake died. AII the animals were extremely happy. They did not have to worry anymore.

Until now, the people of Maluku believe that the bronze crocodile still lives in the Gulf Baguala. The crocodile often shows himself and after that, lots.of fish will follow him.

<tw-passagedata pid="307" name="Tanjung Menangis" tags="" position="438,578">THERE was a great kingdom in Halmahera. The people were sad. The king just died. He was a great king. He was kind and very wise. The people loved him very much.

The king had three children, two sons and one daughter. The son were Baginda Arif and Baginda Binaut, while the daughter was Putri baginda Nuri.

The queen talked to commander of the soldiers. They were discussing about the next king. According to the rule, the first child would be the next king. Therefore, they were preparing a ceremony to inaugurate Baginda Arif to be the new king.

Baginda Binaut heard they conversation. Actually, he had an ambition. he also wanted to be the king. He had a plan. Secretly, he talked to the commander and consequently the commander had to send the queen, Baginda Arif and Baginda Nuri to jail.

The commander agreed. He send them to the jail. The queen, the prince and the princess were very sad. Baginda Binaut told the people that his mother, his brother and his sister were drowned in the sea.

&quot;Binaut is really ungrateful. He is really a bad person,&quot; said Baginda Arif.

&quot;Be patient, my child. God will help us,&quot; said the queen.

Then Baginda Binaut became the new king. Unlike his father, he was very cruel. He asked his people to pay high taxes. The people suffered. They complained but they could not do anything. The soldiers would hurt them.

However, not all the soldiers wanted to follow Baginda Binaut. One of the soldier decided to leave the palace. His name was Bijak. He made his own troops. He knew the queen, the prince and the princess were in jail. He wanted to set them free.

On one night, Bijak and his troops attacked the jail. He wanted to set them free.

On one night, Bijak and his troops attacked the jail. They succeeded! Then he planed to attacked the palace. But the queen did not agree. She did not want to see her own people fighting. The queen then prayed to god.

Not long after that, the mountain erupted. The lava was flowing. It flowed to the palace. The people were running to save their life. Baginda Binaut was also running. Amazingly, wherever he was running, the lava always followed him.

Baginda Binaut was really scared. While he was running, he was thinking of his mother, brother and his sister. He screamed for help.

&quot;Mother, please help me!&quot; He went to the jail but they were not there. He was really panicked because the lava was getting closer to him.

&quot;Help! Help!&quot; screamed Baginda Bimaut but not one helped him.

Finally, Baginda Binaut could not run anymore. He was exhausted and he arrived at the sea. He could not go back to the land because it was full of lava. Then he swam to the sea.

Because he was very tired, he could not swim. He was drowned. Slowly, his body turned into a cave. The people often heard someone crying from the cave, therefore they named it the crying cave or Tanjung Menangis.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="308" name="The Legend of Blue Pond" tags="" position="1680,318">“Hey look over there! Water is flowing!”

A man pointed out to a direction. He saw something strange. Water was fl owing out of the big stones. The water was flowing into a lower ground. Slowly, the ground was full of water.

The water was clear and it was bluish.

“Look! It is blue! I have never seen bluish water like this,” said another man.

And then, he tried to taste the water, “The water is so fresh. Come on, let’s drink the water.”

Those people were villagers in Lisawa, Halmahera. They never saw water coming out of the stones before. It was very strange for them.

“We have to report this to the head of the village,” suggested one man.

They all agreed. Soon, the head of the village arrived at the pond. He was also surprised. The water was clear and bluish. He also wanted to know how it happened. He then asked all the elderly of the village pray to the gods and goddess.

They all prayed and finally they got the answer. The water was flowing from a girl’s tears. She was crying so badly until the tears was flooding the ground.

“Who is she? We need to know who the girl is! Ask all the villagers including their children to gather here,” said the head of the village.

Later, all the villagers gathered in the pond. They all brought their children.

However there were two families who did not bring their children. Those two children were teenagers. The boy was Magohiduruu and the girl was Majojaru.

One woman told the villagers about them. The woman was Majoraru’s mother.

She told them that Magohiduruu and Majojaru were lovers. They planned to get married. A year ago, Magohiduruu left the village to fi nd a better life. He wanted to earn a lot of money before they got married.

A year passed by but Magohiduruu did not come back yet. She finally heard that Magohiduruu was dead. Majojaru was very sad. Everyday she was always sat down under a big tree. She spent her time crying. Majojaru was very sad. She did not believe that Magohiduruu had already died. She always cried. Her parents tried to comfort Majojaru, but she never listened to them. And one day Majojaru disappeared. She never returned to her home.

After they heard the story, all the villagers agreed to take care of the pond. And since the water was bluish, they named the pond as the Blue Pond.</tw-passagedata>

A frog, a turtle, a snail, and all other animals are surprised. They are immediately hiding. They are afraid of the snake. They are worried the snake will harm them.

“Hey! Where is everybody!” says the snake.

He is looking around for all the animals.

“I’m hungry. Give me some food. Come on, get out now!”

The snake goes here and there. Finally he finds them.

“Ha…ha…ha…What are you doing here? Why are you hiding? Are you afraid of me? You should be afraid of me. I’m the biggest animal in this river. I’m your king.”

“You are not our king. There is no king here. Everybody is equal,” says the turtle.

“Let’s prove it! Who wants to fight me? I can beat you easily. With my big body, I can twist you easily. Ha…ha…ha! Now, give me some food!”

The animals are afraid. They don’t have any courage to fight the snake. They then prepare some food for him. After the sake finishes eating and leaves them, they have a meeting.

“We can’t be like this all the time. I want to live peacefully,” says the frog.

“I have and idea. Let’s go to the alligator’s house. Talk to him about our problem. We ask him to help us,” says the fish.

All the animals agree with his idea. Finally, the alligator meets the snake.

“I heard what you do to the animals in the animals in this river. You have to stop your bad behavior,” says the alligator.

“I’m not afraid of you. I will twist your body.” The snake and the alligator than are fighting.

The alligator uses his tail to hit the snake. He does that several times.

“Mercy me, mercy me!” the snake screams in pain.

“Are you still the king in this river? Are you going to harm the animals again?”

“No. I’m not the king and I promise I will be good to them,” says the snake.</tw-passagedata>

While they are sailing, suddenly a dragon comes! The dragon uses his tail to attack people. The tail makes a very big wave in the river. Most of them are drowned. Only one person survives. The person is a woman. She is hanging to her boat and finally arrives in a land.

She is very sad. She is pregnant and her husband is killed. Her boat is broken so she cannot go back to her hometown. Later she gives birth to a son. She names her son Biwar. She raises Biwar and gives skills, like how to make weapons, set traps to catch animals, and how to make fire.

Biwar becomes a handsome, strong, and healthy man. One day she asks his mother.

&quot;Mother, where is my father? And how do we live alone? Where is everybody?&quot;

Biwar&#39;s mother cries.

&quot;Your father is killed by the dragon. I&#39;m the only one survived from the incident. That&#39;s why we live alone here, Son.&quot;

Biwar is very sad. His father has died. Then he plans to take his mother to go back to their hometown.

Biwar makes a big boat. He also makes a lot of weapons. He wants to protect his mother from the dragon. After the boat is ready, they are sailing in the river. While they are sailing, suddenly there is a big wave. The dragon is coming!

<tw-passagedata pid="313" name="The Legend of Coconut Tree" tags="" position="1054,328">ONCE upon a time in the Moor Island in Papua lived a husband and a wife. The husband&#39;s name was Mora, and the wife&#39;s name was Taribuy. They lived alone. There were no any other people lived on the island.

The land in Moor Island was fertile. Every plant grew well. The couple did not have any problems with food. They could eat every fruits and vegetables on the island. The couple lived happily.

Mora and Taribuy did not have any child. The couple hoped they could have one child so their lives would be happier. They prayed to God to give them a child.

And God answered their prayers. Taribuy was pregnant. The couple was extremely happy. Mora worked harder. He cleared the land and he built a bigger house. He asked his wife just to stay at home and did not work hard. He wanted his wife and the baby to be healthy.

Nine months later, the baby was born. He was a baby boy. Mora named him Reio. Mora and Taribuy were very happy. They took care of Reio with love.

Reio grew up as a good kid. He always helped his parents. Every morning he helped his father go hunting the animals and picking up some fruits and vegetables.

One day, Mora and Reio were hunting. While they were looking for the animals, suddenly Mora felt there was something wrong with his body.

&quot;Are you okay, Father?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure, Son. I don&#39;t feel comfortable.&quot;

They went home. Taribuy was really worried. She took care of her husband. She asked her son to pick certain leaves. She wanted to make traditional medicine.

Unfortunately the medicine did not work. Mora&#39;s illness was getting worse. Mora was getting weaker. 

Mora felt he would not live longer. He called his wife and his son and gave them a message.

&quot;My wife and my son, I&#39;m getting weaker. I feel I&#39;m going to die soon.&quot;

&quot;Please, don&#39;t say that, Father. We will do our best to heal you,&quot; said Reio. He was crying.

&quot;That&#39;s okay, Son. I know you and your mother have done your best. But listen. If I die, please bury me in the front yard. Clear my graveyard every day. And when a tree grows in my graveyard, take care of the tree. It will be useful for you,&quot; said Mora.

Not long after that, Mora died. Reio and his mother were very sad. And they did Mora&#39;s request. They buried him in the front yard.

What Mora said was true. A tree grew in Mora’s graveyard. Reio and his mother did not know anything about the tree. It was strange. They had never seen the tree before. The fruit was hard. And when they peeled the skin, they found harder fruit inside. They broke it and found sweet water. And they also found the meat of the fruit was delicious. They loved the tree.

They named the tree as Nera. It means the head of Mora. The tree grew well and now the tree is known as coconut tree.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="314" name="Yomngga and the Dragon" tags="" position="679,325">YOMNGGA was a beautiful girl. She lived with her grandmother. Actually Yomngga had two sisters. But they lived in another village.

Yomngga was a kind girl. She always helped her grandmother in the field. Every morning they went to the field and they always went back home in the afternoon. Every day they took the same route.

They did not know that a dragon was always looking at them when they passed by a big tree. It was the dragon&#39;s house.

The dragon was not an ordinary dragon. During the day he was a dragon, but in the evening he changed into a handsome man. A witch had cursed him.

The dragon fell in love with Yomngga. However he did not know how to express his feeling. He could only stay in the trees during the days. He was afraid people people would kill him if he showed himself. He wanted to visit Yomngga at night when he changed into a human. The problem was he did not know where she lived.

Finally he could not stand it anymore. When he saw Yomngga was almost passing by the big tree, the dragon got off from the tree and approached Yomngga and her grandmother.

Of course they were shocked. They became more shocked when they saw the dragon was able to talk like a human.

&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid. I will not harm you. I just want to know where you live.&quot;

Yomngga was shacking. She did not know what to do. And after she calmed down, she told the dragon about her house. And it made the dragon happy. He then let them continue their trip.

At night the dragon came to the Yomngga&#39;s house. He came as a handsome man. At first, Yomngga was confused. But after the dragon explained about the witch, she understood.

The dragon continued to come to Yomngga&#39;s house on the following nights. Soon they fell in love and get married. Yomngga could understand that her husband always changed into a dragon during the days. The grandmother agreed to their marriage but she asked the dragon to keep on staying in the house when he became a dragon. She did not want the villagers to kill him. Yomngga kept her marriage as their big secret. She even did not tell her two sisters.

Later Yomngga got pregnant. Her two sisters heard the news and they were very curious who her husband was. So they came to Yomngga&#39;s house. When they saw the dragon, they got very angry. And they got very angrier when they knew that the dragon was Yomngga&#39;s husband. They did not care although the dragon changed into a man at nights. They hated the dragon very much. Therefore, they planned to kill him.

One day the two sisters visited the dragon. The dragon did not know that they had prepared poisoned food. When the dragon ate the food, he died instantly.

The villagers saw the dead dragon. The two sisters told the villagers about the dragon. And when the villagers knew that the dragon was Yomngga&#39;s husband, they asked Yomngga to leave the village. Yomngga was very sad. She lost her beloved husband and she had to leave her grandmother in the village.

Yomngga left the village with a sampan. She rowed it along the small river. Since then people named the river as Yomngga&#39;s river.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="315" name="Irimiami and Isoray" tags="" position="930,195">THE people in Papua hold a ceremony of worshiping a magic stone. The ceremony has been a tradition for many generations. Here is the story.

A long time ago in a village in NorthYapen, Papua, there lived a husband and wife named Irimiami and Isoray. Irimiami was a hunter. One day Irimiami just finished hunting. It was not a good day for hirn. He could not catch any animals. Irimiami was tired. He wanted to take a rest. He was looking for a good place to rest. And... Ahal He found a big stone.

Irimiami was happy.He immediately climbed the big stone and sat down on it. At first, he was enjoying the time. He was resting comfortably. Howeveq, slowly he felt the stone was hot. It was getting hotter and he felt the stone was burning his body.

Irimiami thought his body was not feeling well. He did not think anything strange about the stone. Later he went home. On the following day, he went back hunting. This time he was lucky. He caught a deer. On the way back home, he passed by the big stone again. He climbed the stone. He sat down on the stone and he put the deer next to him.

Irimiami was really enjoying sitting down on the big stone. The wind blew and it made him sleepy. However, he felt the storre was very hot. He remembered the last time he was sitting down on the big stone. He also felt the stone was burning his body.

Irimiami was very sure that there&#39;was nothing wrong with his body&#39;. He was healthy enough. He decided to wait and hold the hot. After a while, he could not hold it anymore. It w,as very hot! Irimiami was very sure tl-rat the stone was burning his body. He could not take it anymore. He jumped off the stone. He left the deer still on the stone.

From the ground, he saw something strange. The deer was burned. And late4 the burning finally stopped. Irimiami climbed the stone and brought the deer down. He touched the deer&#39;s body, and ate the meat.

It was really delicious! Irimiami never tasted delicious meat like this. He brought the deer home and asked his wife to eat the meat. Isoray was also surprised! She also enjoyed eating the delicious meat.

&quot;Wow...this is so delicious. What did you do with this rneat my husband?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know what happened. I was sitting on the big stone and I felt very hot. What happened next, I jumped off the stone and left the deer on the big stone. When I took the deer, it was already like this,&quot; explained Irimiami.

&quot;Please take me to the stone tomorrow I want to see its magic,&quot; asked Isorav.

On the following day, Irimiami and Isoray went to the big stone. Irimiami helped Isoray climb the big stone. They both sat down. Slowly. they felt very hot. The stone was burning them.

Irimiami and Isoray could not hold the pain. They climbed down. Isoray was very curious. She took some leaves. She put them on the stone. Slowly, the stone was burning the leaves. The leaves were burned. They saw smoke coming out of the leaves. And later they saw something that they had never seen before. They saw fire!

Irimiami and Isoray were very scared. They had never seen fire in their entire lives. And when the leaves n&#39;ere completely burned, the fire stopped. The couple told other people about the stone.

The villagers were curious. They wanted to eat the delicious meat. They put a dead deer on the stone. And after it was burned, they ate it. It was so delicious. All the villagers were happy. They were very grateful to gods to give them a magic stone. They held a ceremony.

The ceremony lasted for many days. They worshiped the stone. They were thankful to gods. And they were also thankful to Irimiami and Isoray. Thanks to them, the people knew. about fire.

The people in Papua believe that Irimiami and Isoray were the first persons that found fire. And until now they still hold the ceremony.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="316" name="Breaking the Sun" tags="" position="929,320">A long time ago, the sun did not shine too long. It was only shine for a while then it set to the west. Earth was in the dark most of the time. People did not like it. There were not many things they could do during the day. They wished to see the sun shine longer.

There was one man who really hated to be in the dark. His name was Rangga. Everyday he was thinking how he could make the sun shine long enough. One day he had an idea.

&quot;I think the sun is too big to move. If we can break it into some pieces, the sun can move quickly. Therefore we can have enough light from the sun,&quot; said Rangga to his friend.

&quot;But how can we break the sun?&quot; asked one of his friend.

&quot;We can break it by throwing a spear. But it should be a magic spear,&quot; said Rangga.

&quot;How can we get the magic spear?&quot; asked his friend. We ask the elf to guide us to find the magic spear,&quot; asked Rangga.

Then Rangga and his friends meditated in the jungle. It was not an easy thing to do. They were disturbed by wild animals. Luckily they had strong concentration. They were save from the animals. after a while, an elf finally came to them.

&quot;What do you want, my child?&quot; asked the elf.

&quot;We want to break the sun. We need to find a magic spear,&quot; explained Rangga.

&quot;Hmm.. the magic spear belongs to the great thief. You have to fight him and grabs the spears from him, said the elf.

Rangga and his friends understood. They knew about the great thief. They herd that he had a supernatural power. Luckily the elf had also give them the supernatural power to fight against the great thief. Rangga and his friends were looking for the great thief. They finally found him. At first Rangga nicely asked the great thief to give him the spear, but of course the thief refused.

&quot;Why should I give you the spear so you can break the sun? I love darkness. I can steal easily, ha.. ha.. ha..&quot; said the thief.


Rangga and his friend knew that they did not have other choice. Then they were fighting. Thanks to the supernatural power given by the elf. Rangga and friends won the fight.

Finally Rangga held the magic spear. He held it firmly. he did not want to waste the time. He wanted to throw the spear and break the sun.

Rangga concentrated and threw the spear with great power towards the sun. and it worked! The sun was breaking into some pieces. The biggest piece became a moon and the small pieces became the stars.

Since then, the sun shines long enough. and when it set to the west, the earth was not completely in the dark. The moon and the stars gave people enough light.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="317" name="The Unhappy Cendrawasih" tags="" position="804,325">Mr and Mrs Brown Bird lived in a jungle in Papua. Mr Brown always complains about his feathers. He thought they were ugly. He was jealous with his friend, Mr Green Bird.

&quot;I want to have beautiful feathers like Mr Green Bird. His feathers are not brown like mine. They are very beautiful,&quot; said Mr Brown Bird to his wife.

&quot;Honey, you have to be grateful with your feathers. With feathers like this, humans are not interested in us. So they will not hunt us,&quot; said Mrs Brown Bird.

Mr Brown Bird then went to the God of Jungle.

&quot;I want to have beautiful feathers like Mr Green Bird&#39;s feathers,” said Mr Brown Bird.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I can make your wish come true. Just choose one color.&quot;

&quot;Hmm I don&#39;t know. How about red? Yellow? Green? I&#39;m confused.&quot;

The God of Jungle was upset. &quot;Choose now!&quot;

Mr Brown Bird then looked up to the sky. He had an idea.

&quot;Aha! I know which color to choose. I don&#39;t want one color of my feathers. I want many colors. I want my feathers to be colorful like the rainbow in the sky.&quot;

Not longer after that, Mr Brown Bird&#39;s feathers were colorful. When he went home, his wife did not recognize him.

&quot;Honey, it&#39;s me. I&#39;m your husband.&quot;

&quot;No, my husband is not like you! His feathers are brown!&quot; said Mrs brown Bird.

Mr Brown Bird tried very hard to convince his wife realized that he was really her husband.

&quot;You are very stupid, my husband. With color like these, humans will hunt you. What if they also take our children? Now, please go away! Our lives are in danger if you are still here,&quot; said Mrs Brown Bird. She was crying.

Mr Brown Bird was very sad. He knew he just made a very big mistake. He then left his house. His name then changed into Cendrawasih. It means a bird of paradise.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="318" name="Towjatuwa and the Sacred Crocodile" tags="" position="1276,351">ONCE upon a time in Papua, Towjatuwa and his wife lived by the Tami River. They were very happy. They had been waiting to have a baby and after some time, his wife got pregnant. The pregnancy was in the ninth month.

Soon, his wife would give a birth. The days passed by, but his wife was still unable to give birth. She had a problem that made her in greater pain. To help her give the birth, Towjatuma needed a sharp stone. He wanted to have an operation to help his wife.

So, he went to the river side to find a sharp stone. While busy looking for the stone, he heard a noise. He was so scared. He knew the river was full of crocodiles. Just before he left, a big crocodile was in front of him! The crocodile was different from any other crocodiles. It had feathers. The feathers were like kasuwari&#39;s. Towjatuma was ready to run, suddenly the crocodile talked.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m not going to harm you. What are you doing here?&quot; asked the crocodile politely.

Towjatuma was really scared. He was really amazed to see a crocodile talked like humans. After a while, he then answered.

&quot;I&#39;m here to find a sharp stone. My wife is pregnant and she has a problem. She cannot give birth. So, I want to do an operation,&quot; explained Towjatuma.

&quot;I will help you. Go home now and I&#39;ll come to your house tomorrow,&quot; said the crocodile.

Towjatuma immediately went back to his house. When he arrived, he explained about the crocodile to his wife. On the following day, the crocodile came to Towjatuma&#39;s house. With his magical power, the crocodile helped her to give birth. The baby was a boy. The crocodile named him Narrowra.

&quot;Towjatuma, I already helped you. Now I ask you to help me. Your son Narrowra will grow as a great hunter. He has great skills in hunting. He can catch many animals. However, don&#39;t hunt my friends, the crocodiles. You have to tell Narrowra not to hunt crocodiles. And not only Narrowra, all your descendants have to protect crocodiles. If they hunt and eat crocodile meat, all your descendants will die,&quot; said the crocodile.

&quot;Yes, I understand. I will never forget your help. So I will teach my child and all my descendants to protect you and your friends,&quot; said Towjatuma. Since then, Towjatuma and his descendants promised to protect the crocodiles from other hunters. They also protected other animals that lived in the river. </tw-passagedata>
